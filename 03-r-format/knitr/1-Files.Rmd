## Data in Excel

- Formats xls and csv - what's the difference?
- File extensions xls and xlsx are proprietary Excel formats, binary files
- csv is an extension for Comma Separated Value files. They are text files - directly readable.
- Example: Gas prices in midwest since 1994

```{r}
midwest <- read.csv("http://heike.github.io/rwrks/03-r-format/data/midwest.csv")
```
