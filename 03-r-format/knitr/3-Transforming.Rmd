## Using the packages tidyr, dplyr

During a ten week sensory experiment, 12 individuals were asked to assess taste of french fries on several scales (how potato-y, buttery, grassy, rancid, paint-y do the fries taste?)

French fries were fried in one of three different oils, and each week individuals had to assess six batches of french fries (all three oils, replicated twice)

```{r}
french_fries <- read.csv("http://heike.github.io/rwrks/03-r-format/data/frenchfries.csv")
head(french_fries)
```

## This format is not ideal for data analysis

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=2, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

qplot("1_buttery", buttery, data = french_fries, fill = I("red"), geom = "boxplot") +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "2_grassy", y = grassy), fill = I("orange")) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "3_painty", y = painty), fill = I("yellow")) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "4_potato", y = potato), fill = I("green")) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(x = "5_rancid", y = rancid), fill = I("blue")) +
    xlab("variable") + ylab("rating")
```

## What we have and what we want
We want to change this **wide format**:

![Wide Format](images/tableoverview.png)

to this **long format**:

![Long Format](images/tablelong.png)

## Gathering

- When gathering, you need to specify the **keys** (identifiers) and the **values** (measures).

Keys/Identifiers:

- Identify a record (must be unique)
- Example: Indices on an random variable
- Fixed by design of experiment (known in advance)
- May be single or composite (may have one or more variables)

Values/Measures:

- Collected during the experiment (not known in advance)
- Usually numeric quantities

## Gathering the French Fry Data

```{r}
library(tidyr)

french_fries_long <- gather(french_fries, key = variable, value = rating, potato:painty)
head(french_fries_long)
```

## Let's Reconstruct our Plot

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=4, warning=FALSE}
qplot(variable, rating, data = french_fries_long, fill = variable, geom = "boxplot")
```

## Long to Wide

In certain applications, we may wish to take a long dataset and convert it to a wide dataset (Perhaps displaying in a table).

```{r}
head(french_fries_long)
```

## Spread

We use the **spread** function from `tidyr` to do this:

```{r}
french_fries_wide <- spread(french_fries_long, key = variable, value = rating)

head(french_fries_wide)
```

## Your Turn {data-background=#527a7a}

1. Read in the billboard top 100 music data:

```{r}
billboard <- read.csv("http://heike.github.io/rwrks/03-r-format/data/billboard.csv")
```
    
2. Use `tidyr` to convert this data into a long format.

3. Use ``ggplot2`` to create something like this time series plot:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE}
long_billboard <- gather(billboard, key = week, value = rank, X1:X76)
long_billboard$week <- as.numeric(gsub("X", "", long_billboard$week))

qplot(week, rank, data = long_billboard, geom = "line", colour = artist, group = track) +
    xlim(c(0, 30))
```

## Split-Apply-Combine

- *Split* a dataset into many smaller sub-datasets
- *Apply* some function to each sub-dataset to compute a result
- *Combine* the results of the function calls into a one dataset

<img src="images/sac.png" width=500></img>

## Split-Apply-Combine in dplyr

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

french_fries_split <- group_by(french_fries_long, variable) # SPLIT
french_fries_apply <- summarise(french_fries_split, rating = mean(rating, na.rm = TRUE)) # APPLY + COMBINE
french_fries_apply
```

## The pipe operator

- dplyr allows us to chain together these data analysis tasks using the `%>%` (pipe) operator
- `x %>% f(y)` is shorthand for `f(x, y)`
- Example:

```{r}
french_fries %>%
    gather(key = variable, value = rating, potato:painty) %>%
    group_by(variable) %>%
    summarise(rating = mean(rating, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## dplyr verbs

There are five primary dplyr **verbs**, representing distinct data analysis tasks:

- **Filter**: Remove the rows of a data frame, producing subsets
- **Arrange**: Reorder the rows of a data frame
- **Select**: Select particular columns of a data frame
- **Mutate**: Add new columns that are functions of existing columns
- **Summarise**: Create collapsed summaries of a data frame
    
## Filter

```{r}
french_fries %>%
    filter(subject == 3, time == 1)
```

## Arrange

```{r}
french_fries %>%
    arrange(desc(rancid)) %>%
    head
```

## Select

```{r}
french_fries %>%
    select(time, treatment, subject, rep, potato) %>%
    head
```

## Mutate

```{r}
french_fries %>%
    mutate(rancid2 = rancid^2) %>%
    head
```

## Summarise

```{r}
french_fries %>%
    group_by(time, treatment) %>%
    summarise(mean_rancid = mean(rancid), sd_rancid = sd(rancid))
```

## Your Turn {data-background=#527a7a}

Read in the flights data:

```{r}
flights <- read.csv("http://heike.github.io/rwrks/03-r-format/data/flights.csv")
```

This dataset contains information on over 300,000 flights that departed from New York City in the year 2013.

1. Using dplyr and the pipe operator, create a data frame consisting of the average arrival delay (`arr_delay`) based on the destination airport (`dest`). Sort this data frame in descending order, so the destination airport with the largest delay is first.
2. Find out the most used airports for each airline carrier.

## Dates and Times

Dates are deceptively hard to work with in R.

**Example**: 02/05/2012. Is it February 5th, or May 2nd?

Other things are difficult too:

- Time zones
- POSIXct format in base R is challenging

The **lubridate** package helps tackle some of these issues.

## Basic Lubridate Use

```{r, results='hold', message=FALSE}
library(lubridate)

now()
today()
now() + hours(4)
today() - days(2)
```

## Parsing Dates

```{r, results='hold'}
ymd("2013-05-14")
mdy("05/14/2013")
dmy("14052013")
ymd_hms("2013:05:14 14:50:30", tz = "America/Chicago")
```

## Your Turn {data-background=#527a7a}

1. Using the `flights` data, create a new column Date using lubridate. You will need to paste together the columns year, month, and day in order to do this. See the `paste` function.
2. Use `dplyr` to calculate the average departure delay for each date.
3. Plot the date versus the average departure delay

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3}
flights$date <- ymd(paste(flights$year, flights$month, flights$day, sep = "-"))
delay.dat <- flights %>% 
    group_by(date) %>% 
    summarise(dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

qplot(date, dep_delay, geom = "line", data = delay.dat)
```
