### Files 
#-------------------------------------------

	## Your turn 1 - read.table and read.csv Have a look at the parameters of read.table (?read.table) to solve the following problems: 
	# Read the first two lines of the file into an object called midwest_names
	
	midwest_names <- read.csv("http://heike.github.io/rwrks/03-r-format/data/midwest.csv", nrow = 2)

	 	
	#Read everything EXCEPT the first two lines into an object called midwest_data
	
	midwest_data <- read.csv("http://heike.github.io/rwrks/03-r-format/data/midwest.csv", skip = 2)
	
	## Your turn 2 - foreign
	
	# The NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Survey) publishes data in the SAS xport format: http://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Search/nhanes13_14.aspx 
	# Scroll to the bottom, choose one of the datasets (Demographics, Examination, etc.). Download the Data file (XPT) 
	# Use read.xport() to load the file into R
	
	library(foreign)
	read.xport("~/Downloads/BMX_H.XPT")


### Summarizing
#-------------------------------------------

	## Your Turn 1 - Baseball 
	library(dplyr)
	data(baseball, package = "plyr")
	
	
	# MLB rules for the greatest all-time hitters are that players have to have played at least 1000 games with at least as many at-bats in order to be considered.
	# Extend the for loop above to collect the additional information 
	# Introduce and collect data for two new variables: games and atbats
	
	players <- unique(baseball$id) 
	ba <- rep(NA, length(players)) 
	games <- rep(NA, length(players)) 
	atbats <- rep(NA, length(players)) 
	for(i in 1:length(players)) { 
		career <- subset(baseball, id == players[i]) 
		ba[i] <- with(career, mean(h / ab, na.rm = TRUE)) 
		games[i] <- with(career, sum(g, na.rm = TRUE))
		atbats[i] <- with(career, sum(ab, na.rm = TRUE))
	}
	
	## Your turn 2 - dplyr 
	
	# Find some summary statistics for each of the teams (variable team): 
		# How many different (unique) players has the team had? 
		# What was the teamâ€™s first/last season? 
	
	baseball %>% group_by(team) %>% 
	summarise(nplayer = length(unique(id)), first = min(year), last = max(year))
	
	# Challenge: Find the number of players on each team over time. Does the number change?
	
	baseball %>% group_by(team, year) %>% 
	summarize(nplayer = n()) %>% 
	ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x = year, y = nplayer, group = team, color = team))
	

### Transforming 
#-------------------------------------------

	## Your turn 1 - wide to long
	
	# Read in the billboard top 100 music data: 
	
	billboard <- read.csv("http://heike.github.io/rwrks/03-r-format/data/billboard.csv") 
	# Use tidyr to convert this data into a long format.
	
	library(tidyr)
	
	billboard %>% group_by(artist, track) %>% 
	gather(week, rank, X1:X76) -> bb_long
	
	# more tidying
	
	bb_long$week <- as.numeric(sub("X","",bb_long$week))
	bb_long <- na.omit(bb_long)
	
	
	# Use ggplot2 to create something like this time series plot:
	
	ggplot(data = bb_long) + geom_line(aes(x = week, y = rank, 
										group = track, color = artist))
	
	## Your turn 2 - pipes
	
	# Read in the flights data: 
	
	flights <- read.csv("http://heike.github.io/rwrks/03-r-format/data/flights.csv") 
	
	#This dataset contains information on over 300,000 flights that departed from New York City in the year 2013. 
	
	# Using dplyr and the pipe operator, create a data frame consisting of the average arrival delay (arr_delay) based on the destination airport (dest). Sort this data frame in descending order, so the destination airport with the largest delay is first. 
	
	flights %>% group_by(dest) %>% 
	summarise(avg_delay = mean(na.omit(arr_delay))) %>% 
	arrange(desc(avg_delay))
	
	
	# Find out the most used airports for each airline carrier. 
	
	flights %>% group_by(carrier, origin) %>% 
	summarise(count = n()) %>% 
	ungroup() %>% group_by(carrier) %>% 
	filter(count == max(count)) %>% 
	rename(mostused = origin) %>%
	mutate(kind = "origin") -> by.origin
	 
	flights %>% group_by(carrier, dest) %>% 
	summarise(count = n()) %>% 
	ungroup() %>% group_by(carrier) %>% 
	filter(count == max(count)) %>% 
	rename(mostused = dest) %>% 
	mutate(kind = "dest") -> by.dest
	
	rbind(by.origin,by.dest) -> mostused 
	
	mostused %>% group_by(carrier) %>% 
	filter(count == max(count)) %>% ungroup() %>%
	arrange(desc(count)) 
	
	## Your turn 3 - lubridate
	
	# Using the flights data, create a new column Date using lubridate. You will need to paste together the columns year, month, and day in order to do this. See the paste function. 
	
		library(lubridate)
		flights$Date <- as.Date(paste(flights$year, flights$month, flights$day, sep = "-"))
		
	# Use dplyr to calculate the average departure delay for each date. Plot the date versus the average departure delay
	
	flights %>% group_by(Date) %>% 
	summarise(avg_delay = mean(na.omit(dep_delay))) %>%
	ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = avg_delay))
