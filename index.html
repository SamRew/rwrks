The package ggplot2 gives a framework to produce elegant, high-end graphical displays following the technical framework of the Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson 2000). We will use a lot of data examples to work through the basic plots as well as more advanced tools, such as facetting, colors, shapes and more.</td>

<td>Learn how to quickly and painlessly organize, clean, manipulate, and summarize your data!
Tasks that take hours in Excel take only minutes in R once you learn how to use the stringr, plyr,
and reshape2 packages! In addition, learn how to read data in directly from Excel files and
other common formats.If it takes forever to get records re-formatted from rows to columns, this is the course for you!
These packages also provide good ways of producing summaries at all different levels of your data.
If you are a SAS wiz, but want to make use of R's cool graphics, this course will give you an idea of how to re-work data in the same way as SAS PROC summary.</td>

<td>Knitr is an R package which allows the user to combine statistical coding with document creation into a single automated, coherent process. Do you hate the tedious process of pasting graphics into a paper and making sure they stay in the correct place? Instead, simply write everything in one place using LaTeX and knitr, and press a button - knitr places all the output into the final document automatically! This saves immense amounts of time in all the little tedious tasks inherent in writing reports. Furthermore, if you have to make a small change in your analysis, you can just fix it and re-compile your document, instead of manually changing every picture and table!With knitr, it's easy to create reproducible analyses and keep your code together with the context, so you don't wonder "How did I get these results and which data set did I use to get them?" after 6 months.This class will teach you how to create pdf documents with knitr and LaTeX using R. We will also show you how to easily create webpages showing your entire analysis, complete with pictures, tables, and code. You should be familiar with R, but you do not need to know LaTeX or HTML to participate.</td>
