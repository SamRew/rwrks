<td>ggplot2: One graphics package to rule them all! The package ggplot2 gives a framework to produce elegant, high-end graphical displays following the technical framework of the Grammar of Graphics (Wilkinson 2000). We will use a lot of data examples to work through the basic plots as well as more advanced tools, such as facetting, colors, shapes and more.<br>
Maps, time series charts and some dynamic graphics? - ggplot2 can help you with that! </td>

<td>Howdy R users! Unorganized and unruly data got you in a pickle? Come on down to the Data Wrasstlin' portion of the Week of R and we'll help you learn the tools to quickly and painlessly organize, clean, manipulate, and summarize your data. You can put the trials of manipulating data in Excel out of your mind and use your ace in the hole, the dplyr, tidyr, and stringr packages, to get your data into order in minutes. Learn how to read data in directly from Excel files and other common formats. If it takes forever to get records re-formatted from rows to columns, this is the course for you! Yeehaw!</td>

The shiny package allows us to create interactive applets for teaching, data analysis, or publication, without requiring knowledge of HTML or JavaScript!. See some of the fantastic applets at <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/showcase/">http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/showcase/</a>, and learn how to create applets of your own in our workshop. This session is designed as a workshop, so <b>bring your data and analysis code</b>, and leave with a Shiny applet! (If you don't have data you'd like to use for this, we'll provide you with some data to play with!)</td>

<td>Knitr is an R package which allows the user to combine statistical coding with document creation into a single automated, coherent process. Do you hate the tedious process of pasting graphics into a paper and making sure they stay in the correct place? Instead, simply write everything in one place using LaTeX and knitr, and press a button - knitr places all the output into the final document automatically! This saves immense amounts of time in all the little tedious tasks inherent in writing reports. Furthermore, if you have to make a small change in your analysis, you can just fix it and re-compile your document, instead of manually changing every picture and table!With knitr, it's easy to create reproducible analyses and keep your code together with the context, so you don't wonder "How did I get these results and which data set did I use to get them?" after 6 months.This class will teach you how to create pdf documents with knitr and LaTeX using R. We will also show you how to easily create webpages showing your entire analysis, complete with pictures, tables, and code. You should be familiar with R, but you do not need to know LaTeX or HTML to participate.</td>

<td>The World Wide Web spurred new opportunities to find and access massive amounts of information. Unfortunately, structured data is often embedded within unstructured documents, making it difficult incorporate into a data analysis workflow. This workshop will give you the skills necessary to transform unstructured web content into a form suitable for data analysis. </td>
