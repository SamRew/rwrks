That is nonsense. I don't identify as ""gay"", but that is the closest choice I had; queer is much more accurate. Whew, alright.... I am a down to earth, fun person. I love being spontaneous, and having fun while being goofy and dorky. I can be a little shy at first, but once I get to know someone, I open right up. I am an honest and fiercely loyal person. I believe in sticking up for yourself and those you care for. People tend to see me, or pics and see the more masculine/boi side of me, but, what they don't see is the matching underwear sets, the toe nails that are ALWAYS painted (usually pink, but sometimes I venture away to another bright, fun colour), the lip gloss in fruity or sweet flavours, the pretty dresses that are hanging up in my closet that come out to play for nights of dinner and dancing. I really feel that gender is a much more fluid thing that most people see it as. I like to think that I am a pretty great mash-up of all the many points on the spectrum. I think that open, honest communication is a must for a healthy, well-functioning, equal partnership/ relationship. I love doing non-mainstream things; checking out a film festival, checking out a local band, hitting the Farmer's Market early in the morning so I can talk to the venders/farmers. I love photography, and walking around cemeteries taking pictures of the amazing sculptures/ architecture. As a Pastry Cook, I am a huge foodie!!!! Anything food or food related is sure to make my head spin!! lol lol Nothing is more sexy to me than someone who can jump into a kitchen, and pull an amazing meal out of whatever is in the cupboards. Someone who is able to push me out of the kitchen (not an easy feat! lol) and make a meal for me. But, also someone who loves being in the kitchen with me and making a meal together. I am hoping to find someone down to earth, not into head games. Who knows what s/he wants, and is willing to work at getting it. Someone who understands how important family and friends are. Someone who is all about surprising me with fun things, and being goofy, and silly, but can settle into a night of movies, board games or having a few friends over. I am also looking to chat and meet new people from all over. I like the idea of having people from all around to chat with, and once my ""travel the world"" plans shapes up it would be fun to be able to pop in and meet these peeps. I am not looking for serious, or long-distance partners/ relationships, but I do think that the age of ""pen-pals"" has horribly gone away since the invention of technology; I would like to try and bring it back, a la 2012 with computers! :)"

I attend Campbell University and am currently majoring in Psychology. I am nice, caring, a bit of a goofball, easy goinh and very much a Romanic. I like to meet new people, hang out, joke around, cook,laugh, go for walks, listen to music, write, help people out, watch movies, play my Xbox 360 and PS3. I very much want to learn to fish lol Idk why I just do. I like to watch football and sometimes basketball. My favorites team are the Redskins and the Lakers. I don't really like to fight or argue with people. I try my best not to but I do mess up sometimes. I prefer to make everyone I care about happy. I will go out of my way just to do so at times. When it comes to being in a relationship, I choose to be very open with my feelings. I like to cuddle, make out, hold, hands, basically just spend quality time together. You don't have to take me out to the fanciest places or anything. Just staying in watching a movie and spending time together is good enough for me. I only get into a relationship with someone if I feel like we could last a very long time and possibly end in marriage. I don't really like ""dating"". In the end all I really want to do is take care of my family. I'm more of the traditional type so I wouldn't mind being a stay at home wife though I don't mind working either. I want to meet the man I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. I only want to get married once, no divorce. He doesn't have to be perfect but he does have to be willing to communicate with me and put in the work needed to make our relationship strong and to make it last."

Recently I've come to have adventures searching for UFO's near Alamosa, paranormal investigations, and hiking through the Cave of the Winds. I love traveling and try to make a trip out of state or country once a year. Essentially I have to say that I probably don't act anywhere close to my age and prefer telling jokes, having nerf gun wars out of the blue, and pulling pranks. On the other hand, I enjoy a good intellectual debate and philosophical discussion. I like to contemplate the workings of the universe and whether that has shaped our existence on this planet.

I am new to this online thing, but decided it was time to give it a try. My name is Chrystal I am 27 years old and was divorced last year. I am currently finishing my degree in Elementary Education, where I then intend to go on and get my Masters. I have a car, its a real clunker but its mine. I just moved back into town from Florida. I was down there visiting my sister for a few months. I have decided that it is time to for me to make some major moves in my life. So instead of just dipping my foot in the water so to say, I am diving right in. I am..... 1. A Geek/Nerd: I love video games! There is no changing this part of me. Console, Online, board games, ect. ( I am currently learning the art of playing Magic and D&D. I have played an online MMO for about 9 years now and I love it. I also really enjoy playing my Xbox or PS3. My favorite game series is by far the Final Fantasy series. I have played every game including the NES games from back in the 90's. I own a DS, PS3, PS2, and an Xbox 360. I will try any game once and if I like it I will most certainly beat it. (BTW if you are a sore loser, and can't stand it if a girl beats you at a game then don't even bother responding to me.) 2. A Family-First Girl: I will do almost anything for my family. I love them. I have 2 sisters and a brother. I have 3 nieces and a nephew and one (unknown gender) on the way. My nieces and nephew are my life. I love all of them as if they were my own. As far as dating someone with kids I have no problems with that. The only thing I really want to stay away from is baby mama drama. Now here is something very important. I ABSOLUTELY WANT KIDS, now I don't care if its naturally or adopted, but I do want to be a mother. I am also looking for someone who is family oriented and feels the same way. 3. Rockstar: I love music, theatre, dancing and everything in between. I love going out and doing karaoke and open mics nights on a regular basis. Music is such a big part of who I am and without it or theatre in my life I don't believe I would be me. It would be like taking a basic need from me. (ie: water, food, shelter) I know that sounds extreme but when you are passionate about something it embodies your entire soul. I love all styles of music.When I say all styles I mean EVERYTHING. There are certain artists or songs I don't care for but there is not a single genre that I dislike. Being on stage is the biggest high for me. Performing=life. 4. Student: I am a student and I love it. Learning is another thing that I am very passionate about. I guess that is why I am going into education. I am sure my love for children has something to do with it also, but I know I can't wait to make a difference in kid's lives. I am a simple girl who doesn't expect alot but I want to be respected. I have done the whole being married to someone who really didn't wanna be married to me thing and it didn't work. I am hoping that this could have better effects. I am hoping to meet someone who will actually read this profile and not just look at my pictures and ask to have sex. I am a passionate person but that doesn't mean I am easy or willing to have one night stands. I want to get to know you, and hopefully there will be a spark that we can build something on."

I am a happy person, however, I want to be able to share my life, and what I have to offer, with another. I enjoy and showing affection. I consider myself romantic. I believe in giving to good causes or doing volunteer activities that make the world a better place.Physical appearance is not the most important thing for me in looking for a partner.

I like to enjoy life to the fullest. Life is too short to be miserable and so I am always happy and you will never find anger or frown on my face.I believe it gives wrinkles. I am a type of person who doesn't take life too serious. I believe that mutual respect guides me with my encounter with others. I like trying different foods, cultures, and environments. I have spent a lot of time thinking about what works and doesn't work in a relationships.I have found that you can have more than one great love in your life.Some may come in and leave special imprints on our hearts and then move on for one reason or another.We've all had our share of disappointments,but we haven't given up search to find someone special that makes our hearts skip a beat.All we can do is take one day at a time...enjoy those special moments in each day until we find that one special person that touches our heart in the way no one else can.I want to continue living my life believing that ""Life is not being measured by the breaths you take...but by the moments that take your breath away.""Dare to dream that the best is yet to be."

I suggest you move along. I identify as something called Demisexual. Basically, it means that I'm not sexually attracted to someone unless an intimate, emotional bond has already been established. When I say someone, this could be a guy.. a girl.. or neither of the above. No, no, no. This does not mean that I'm attracted to other species when I say ""neither of the above."" I mean, I can just as easily be attracted to someone who doesn't identify as male or female as I can to someone who does. I'm also what you would call... someone who is body-positive. I believe that every body has the potential to be beautiful in the right eyes. Does this mean that my eyes are always the right eyes for everyone? Not necessarily. Now, before you read any more on my profile, I have to tell you.. I'm a witch. No seriously! A rough definition is anyone that practices a form of witchcraft. I, myself, follow a pagan religion known as heathenism. It focuses on the practices, traditions, and pantheon of Gods that are native to the Norse, Scandinavian, Saxon, Welsh, Celtic, and some eastern European peoples. Although my ancestors were Welsh, I typically use the Norse terms for Gods, Goddesses, Holidays, etc. simply because they are more commonly used and widely known. Uhm, I believe that's the basics. I'm always up for questions on anything. So feel free to ask."

I spent six years in school, only to decide that my chosen career was not for me, so I went back to school to pursue a new one and I LOVE IT!!! As far as I am concerned, I am definitely not your average girl. I pretty much live in jeans and a t-shirt with my ridiculously curly hair pulled up because it drives me nuts most of the time. I dress up nice when the occasion requires it, but generally I prefer to keep it casual. I am barefoot 99% of the time because I hate wearing shoes, and only do so when I have to. I love being outside regardless of the weather, but I especially love taking a run/walk in the rain. I enjoy all different types of outdoors activities, but I am a huge clutz so its almost a guarantee I will walk away bruised or bleeding, doesn't stop me from trying though! In terms of my personality, I am a quiet until you get to know me and then I am so not at all. I love to laugh and do it as much as possible, so any guy who can make me laugh is golden in my book. I speak sarcasm as a second language and self deprecating humor is what generally gets me through the day. But hey if you can't laugh at yourself then whats the point? I think a lot, my mind is always working double time regardless of what I am doing which often results in random conversations while my mind jumps from one thought to another. I am also fully capable of carrying on an intense conversation or debate when I feel strongly enough about something. Good conversation is one of my favorite pastimes, nothing beats sitting down over drinks and talking for hours. Overall, I am a laid back, super casual girl who is just looking for someone who accepts me as is. I am looking for a guy who is caring, honest, and compassionate. Someone who is cool with going out for dinner and a movie or staying in on a rainy day reading together. My ideal match will accept me for me regardless and will get the same in return. And tops in my book is someone who can make me laugh, because I think laughter is key to any relationship. Don't know what else to write, if you have any questions feel free to drop me a line....."

I have made tons of friends and dated someone briefly for a few months but aside from that I haven't really met anyone I am interested in. I have had a dream of living in California since I was a little girl. My brother got stationed here so I figured the time was right. If I hadn't come when I did I likely never would have... Score for checking that off my bucket list! I graduated from nursing school with my BSN before I moved and earned my California nursing license in late February, now I am on the hunt for my first RN job. The market is brutal here in SD for new grads but thankfully I have other skills and am an awesome people person and was able to get a bar tending gig at a very funky and hip restaurant to hold me over. I ride mountain bikes at least twice a week and whoever I end up dating needs to be into that too... It is my favorite hobby and I really want to be able to share that with my partner. I just bought a wet suit and want to start doing some ocean swimming... And maybe eventually try to learn how to surf! I would be remiss not to mention that I am a mega clutz... I crash pretty much every time I ride my bike and have a long history of tripping over and walking into things. I fully expect you to laugh at me when this happens barring serious injury because I promise I will laugh at you if and when the tables are turned! I am super goofy, I look for excuses to wear costumes to events and I generally don't care if someone thinks I am nerdy or dorky... Because I am! I know who I am and what I want and I promise I won't waste your time if I think we aren't a good match. I don't want kids, people keep telling me I will change my mind but I am 35 and I haven't yet. I do want to find someone who is open to developing a deep, meaningful and committed relationship and who isn't separated or divorced with in the last two years. I am an excellent communicator and a giver, would be really nice to date someone who is also a giver. I love doing special extra things for people I care about to make sure they know they are special to me. If the words OCD, anxious, antisocial, cynical or impatient apply to you you need not apply. I have a cat named Molly, I love her and she's not going anywhere so it is mandatory that someone I date loves her too!"

On my best day I'm Fanny Brice from Funny Girl or sassy comi Barbra in The Way We Were before she meets Robert Redford. But wait, I do have goy-love sometimes....well maybe a lot of the time....so maybe I have more in common with post-Robert Redford Barbra?

Yentl makes me especially happy--I mean who wouldn't fall in love with a Jewish lady from the shtetle who dresses up as a boy to be a talmudic scholar. So. hot. Old Hollywood glam does it for me. I like watching Studio-Era films and wearing red lipstick, if you don't like either I'm probably not the gal for you. Also, a word to the wise: I frequently change my sexual orientation on here depending on my mood. Sometimes I'm ""gay,""other times I'm ""bisexual. "" Sometimes I feel like a lesbian, sometimes not. If labels are going to exist, I figure its my prerogative to fuck with them. So I prefer the term ""queer""--I'm generally more oriented towards women but I've been in a serious relationship with a man recently, so go figure. Sexuality is weird."

I love being outdoors and if possible on the water. I love to try new activities, and just explore new places. I have competed in a lot of different sports, but the one that takes up most of my time is rowing. I love to watch sporting events, golf and baseball are a little slow of sports for me, but I can watch them if I need to. But I would rather be watching football, rugby or hockey, or just getting outside and enjoying the NW. When there is snow on the mountains, I do love to go snowboarding, even though I am pretty bad at it. I do have fun. Hiking and camping are always fun. Overall, I am a pretty active person, and would rather be active outside in the elements then just in a gym. I am from Seattle, but I moved away for a 5 years for college (University of Texas at Austin) and a job (Colorado). I like being back (in Seattle), but I love to travel and would love to be able to live (even for a short or long period of time) in some of the other really cool places in the world. I love to cook and bake. I have in the past shown up at friends houses and cooked entire meals for them because I wanted to cook and they wanted the food. I also tend to bake pies when people are sick or injured. Soup is good, but it feels so much better to just eat a pie from the center out when your not feeling so well. So ""no soup for you!"" With that being said, it is always fun to try new places to eat from the fancy places to dive bars. You can be surprised by the pretty good food that can be found in the most random places. Overall I am a pretty easy going, very honest, and straight forward person. I don't believe in running people around in circles. Just say what you mean, don't do wishy-washy B.S. Following in the line of being honst and straight forward, don't even bother if: 1. If you are not at least as tall as me, you can be a good friend but it's not going to be more then that. Sorry guys, I don't want to bend in half, and I have a thing for tall guys. And if you say you can wear heels (that is great for you) but does not work for me. I am tall, yes I know that, and I like to wear heels every once and a while. 2. If you are just looking for friends with benefits (or insert any other random Ashton Kutcher/Justin Timberlake/romantic comedy along those lines) or a **** buddy, it just is not going to happen. I am not looking for a random hook-up. So if you just want the benefits, keep looking else where. 3. If you are not into full figure/curvy women then I'm not the girl for you. I know that I am curvy, and no matter how much I like to workout, my curves aren't going anywhere. I've had them my whole life, and that is not going to change for anyone.

I am creative, spontaneous and kinda weird. I think normal is boring and I really don't care what people think of me. I'm really just looking for someone that likes to have fun and will be silly with me. I talk a lot, especially when I'm nervous. I'm pretty confident in what I'm good at. I'm blunt and tell it like it is, but I have a compassionate heart and always root for the underdog. I love craft beer (particularly double IPAs and Imperials) and pool. I play on 2 APA pool leagues and an 8ball express team. I love everything outdoors- parks, camping, hiking and pretty much every sport, particularly Football. I am a diehard Carolina Panther's fan and don't care how bad we do, they will always be my #1. I am a UNC basketball fan and Mets baseball fan. I LOVE to travel. I've been to 16 countries and want to backpack Europe with no plan of how to go about it. I am in Nursing School and have one year left. Its literally killing me but I love it and know that caring for others is what I am supposed to do with my life. Thats pretty much it, in a nutshell I suppose!"

I do need quiet time though where I can relax with a glass of wine and some fun TV. I have a dry sense of humor but friends have said I'm pretty funny. Some other words to describe me are loyal, genuine and caring. The guy I'm looking for is well-rounded. He is outgoing and likes to laugh but can enjoy a quiet night at home. He's intelligent, motivated and takes good physical care of himself. He is interested in both sports and the arts... and if he enjoys karaoke and/or dancing I will be VERY happy. Oh, and I love a guy with a killer smile. :-D Lastly, I'm looking for a guy who can communicate. This is critical to any relationship, but specifically when it's with your partner. Couples need to be able to share what's going on inside and talk through their differences. They also need to really listen and be open minded. And I can't stress enough, communication has to be verbal. In this day and age so much communication goes on via text, email, etc. I'm not anti-technology, but if two people can't sit together and have a meaningful conversation it isn't going to work. I'm ready to find my life partner. If you're serious about a relationship and want to meet a great girl, drop me an email. I look forward to talking with you."

I currently am in community college after two years of pointless University schooling, realizing a specific major wasn't for me. I'm currently in a serious relationship with my Macbook. ): By that I mean, I'm deeply passionate for PC gaming. As of current, I play League of Legends in the NA server (full serious mode - Gold V on 3v3's and Bronze I on solo/duo queue), as well as, the Assassin's Creed series games. I also enjoy a little GTA here or there (or, basically stealing cars and shooting cops). Pokemon's pretty cool too, I own Sapphire on GBA, Black on DS, and Colosseum on GC. Oh, oh. I also love K-pop (Korean pop). (: SNSD, Wondergirls, Taeyang, Big Bang, Rania, and G-Dragon, are a few of my favorites.

I did not start out that way but it was what I became. I was naturally quiet and quite shy, always hiding behind my long mane of blondness as I moved around the outer perimeters of my mostly adult world. No one took much notice of me. My father would regularly forget me in department stores and go home without me in tow. I was so quiet and complacent that he would forget he had me with him â at least, that was the excuse he gave to my Bubbe when he periodically arrived home without me. More or less, I was the inconvenient child among a world of adults. Everything changed in my world when I was thirteen. The world outside my home suddenly stood up and took notice of me in a way which might have overwhelmed anyone but a daughter waiting to rebel against the silence of her world. I swore I would never be silent again. The world was wide open to me and I was determined to experience it. From this point on, I did what I wanted, whenever I wanted. Society had rules and social conventions which I would or would not follow - depending on my mood. And now, after 50 years, peace is what I crave, but chaos is often what I leave in my wake. I write, I paint, I care for those close to meâ¦.and still, there is something which drives me to seek, to search, to know â what, I am not sure of. I just hope that when I find it, I will know what âit' is."

To be honest, I hate doing these, ""Tell me about yourself"" things. It's like, ""I don't want to sound like an egotistical jerk, but how else are people gonna think I'm interesting?"" Oh well, here goes...first and foremost, I love God with a strong passion. I try to represent Christ in the best way I can. I love everything that He has done for me and I thank Him for it everyday. I also love learning about different cultures, and exploring ways of life other than my own. I'm bilingual; I speak English and Spanish, and I love it when I get the chance to speak Spanish to others. Hopefully once I'm done with my Bachelors, I'll be able to use my gift of being bilingual to help others who may not know how to speak English. I'm also very interested in Eastern Asian culture; I like listening to Kpop (Korean pop music) and I can say a few phrases in both Korean and Japanese. I also like video games, football, MMA fights, and things that are considered ""guy stuff"" (Pfft, whatever THAT means!) But other than God, my second strongest passion lies in dancing. Salsa dancing is something that I strive to do better at, and I feel like it is truly a blessing from the Lord to be able to express myself through the art of dance. That's probably what you'll find me doing on Saturday nights! Okay, I'm kind of rambling now, so i'll wrap it up here... Okay, enough about me. I hope I haven't either scared you off or now you think I'm a complete weirdo..."

I am a big daddy's girl as far as when it comes to my real dad lol step dad wise..mmmmm...not so much lol My hobbies are music and photography. I love photography so much its my passion. I love the feeling of being behind a tiny lens and capturing something most people think as just a photo, but in my mind its my artistic domain, a photograph is worth a thousand words but I rather focus on the beauty thats captured within it. Music calms my mind and helps me get through problems that I let build up inside of me. It is my life and without it I prolly would go crazy. Music is what best discribes me, it reflects my feelings and moods. I love it all. I love to write, I write how I feel, it helps me deal with things I've been through and its kind of a reflection on how far I've come from back in the past till know. My favorite poets are William Shakesphere, Edgar Allen Poe, and Emily D.i.c.kenson. I am currently in online schooling going for my degree in Psychology. After that I am perusing on getting my arts degree. My goal in life is to be that person I wish I had when I was going through personal issues in my life, that person who's been there, went through it all, and understands and isn't someone who has no clue about how I feel and just says oh it will be ok kinda bs because they dont know what else to say. Yeah, we've all had that person. I just want to know that when I pass away, I made a difference in someones life, thats all I ever really want. I really don't want to keep rambling and I have to leave somethings a mystery or else we'll have nothing to talk about. I'm a real nice person don't want to take my word on it, find out yourself.

I take the good with the bad, and try my hardest to go with the flow and adapt. I'm a lover and a fighter, and I'm not afraid of living.

I find all the little things in life the most beautiful. I try to learn something new everyday, and I strive to be better than I was yesterday. It doesn't take much for me to get lost in my own thoughts. On a completely different unrelated note, I'm a complete geek. If you want to start a conversation with me, start talking about Harry Potter. I will go on for HOURS about that freakin series. Seriously, it's kinda pathetic lol.

I enjoy the simple things in life, so I'd much prefer someone that can be genuine rather than someone that's out to impress people. I am who i am, so what you see is what you get, and I'm the kind of girl that would rather be in my jeans than in a dress any day of the week. I love being with my friends, they're more like my family. I like being in the mountains, especially when it gets cold and snowy. I love to laugh, it's the best cure for most anything that's got someone down. I also love to cook/bake, which is something i'd love to do for a career since it seems to be what i'm best at, at this point. I find it fun and relaxing, but I'm more of a baker than anything ^_^. I love tattoos, if they aren't your thing, that's your opinion, everyone's entitled to one. I am a total Disney nut. I have been forever, and I don't see myself changing any time soon. Chances are, at any given point in the day, if I'm not singin along with music, I'm at least listening to it. I've been singin as long as I can remember and more than likely I'll be singin till i die. I'm not up for drama. Ever. I've never had the patience for it and I never will. I'm blunt, and I always have been, and I have no problem tellin it like is, cuz I see no point in beating around the bush. That being said, I really don't like talking about myself much, it makes me feel weird. Family is important to me, and I want my own at some point. Ask me anything, there are few questions that I won't answer, and if you so happen to stumble upon one of those few, I'll tell you."

I was recently commissioned for an image for a Locks for Love flier. Working on portraits now. I like independent comics. I doodle comics sometimes. I need a website to put my stuff up, but I get shy and usually back off before I begin designing the site. Maybe one day I can be a legit professional. I smoke, I drink. Everyone has their vices. I like reading and writing short stories, not much into writing poetry... Although I have had a poem published, years ago. I like morbid shit. I used to be a spook kid, guess I haven't grown out of it yet. Meh. I like some video games, some movies. I listen to radio, I have a record player. I dig on punk, jazz, and bluegrass.

I'm Allison. I am a very outgoing, loud, and friendly person.I can be a little shy at first, but I usually get over it rather quickly. I took a little break after High School and just worked a lot but now it's time to get my life on track and go to college. I want to become a nurse. I'm looking around, Wright State University seem like a really good school for nursing but I am not completely sure where I want to go yet. Family is huge for me and I could not live without them. As far as music is concerned I like a little bit of everything. I mainly have pop blasting in my car but I might crank out some Metallica depending on my mood ;) I am very energetic and need someone that can keep up! I am also wanting to start working out soon to get back into shape. I try to live a healthy life style but I am totally down with gorging on wings and pizza on game day! or going to wing night at Bdubs. Or the occasional fast food trip at 3am... ANYWAY I said I try to live healthy... didn't say I was successful haha. God is important in my life and I could not imagine a world without him. What I love: I love bubble baths, bubble wrap, bubblegum, actually I just like bubbles in general. I like going on long drives with no destination. I love Christmas! I am like a little kid, I get so excited and I truly am happier around Christmas. However, my favorite season is autumn. I like to sing. This DOES NOT mean I am good at it hahaha. I like going down to the creek and exploring. I like to fish and shoot targets. I love my Nintendo 64. I like school. Yes, I like school. I like to look good and dress nice but I also like relaxing in sweat pants. I like cleaning, decorating, going to parks, and going out to eat. What I Hate: I hate traffic, I have road rage. I hate when fat people complain that they are fat. I hate sneezing! I hate coffee and tea. I very much dislike using public bathrooms. I hate bad grammar and stupidity. I hate people who microwave their kids and say they didn't know it would kill them. I hate thug life. I hate reality TV shows. I dislike the color purple. I hate being unproductive. I hate waking up in the morning. I HATE spiders. I hate any movie scenes that include spiders, especially giant spidersâ¦ like in Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. I HATE THEM. I HATE THEM SO MUCH. Also... please send me something other than ""hey whats up?"". Do you know how many of those I get? I'm at the point where I just delete those. No offense to you or anyhting, I'm sure you're all great guys... but come on! be creative! Show me I'm worth more than 2 seconds of your time. Also... same rules apply to those of you that like to copy and paste these huge letters to me... I can tell if you just sent it to 100 girls or it you wrote it just for me. So keep that in mind. Anyway, I believe thats it. Message me if you have any questions! :) ""Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere!"" -Albert Einstein"

YES, VIDEO CHATTING AND JERKING OFF WITH CHICKS YOU MET ON FACEBOOK WHILE BEING IN A COMMITED RELATIONSHIP IS CONSIDERED CHEATING! IF YOU AND I START A RELATIONSHIP AND WE BECOME SERIOUS, THEN THATS THAT! YOUR COMMITMENT IS TO ME AND NOT WHOMEVER ELSE YOU CAN FUCK AROUND WITH AND GET OFF TO! I HATE HATE HATE HATE CHEATERS, AND DO NOT CONDONE CHEATING!!!!! WITH THAT SAID.....LETS START OFF ABOUT ME: I am just about a Dorsey Culinary Arts Graduate. I am completing my externship at Chilis where I am a Prep/Line Cook. I love cooking and I am AWESOME at it! It's a true passion! I will graduate in October of this year, and when I do, I will be a Certified Chef! I have my Nutrition Certification, a Servsafe Certification, and Kitchen Management Skills! I also love animals, and I have a dog, cat, 2 ferrets, bearded dragon, snapping turtle, and rat. They are all my babies, and are all very spoiled. I am what I would like to say Nerd. I like to play games. I am currently playing Wow again. I love comics and comic movies. I just seen the new Superman movie, and it was EPIC! I have seen, and own Thor, Captain America, The Avengers, all the Batman movies, the Iron Man movies, Smallville series, so on and so forth. I also enjoy shows like Sons of Anarchy, True Blood, Dexter, Shameless, 2broke Girls, Big Bang Theory, Girl Code, Awkward, Hardcore Pawn, Storage Wars, and just about anything on Discovery, National Geographic, A&E, and History. I also enjoy mobster type movies and shows. Also Paranormal stuff. I'm very much a hardcore believer in the after life, ghosts and spirits, haunted houses, and i'm gonna be upfront and honest when I say I have the ability to sense and even hear and see paranormal activity. I love camping, FISHING!! (I HAVE A TACKLE BOX THAT MAKES MOST MEN JEALOUS!) Bowling, going out to the movies, sitting around a campfire on colder nights, grilling, smoking food such as ribs, salmon, or GOOD BRISKET, swimming... My favorite season is the Fall, and my favorite holiday is Halloween! I'm a HUGE HALLOWEEN FANATIC!! I LOVE HAUNTED HOUSES, and I love going to them! Concerts are fun as well. I like a lot of different music. I love going to the Detroit Zoo, or any zoo in general. I love going to the ocean, and love being around the water. I enjoy making my own soaps, candles, body lotions, and stuff like that. I would like to get into jewelry making. I am of Wiccan Beliefs. (AND NO IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SATAN, OR BEING SATANIC, OR KILLING GOATS, OR SACRIFICING VIRGINS!) It just means that basically I worship the earth, the elements (air, fire, water, earth, and spirit) and i believe in good things. I believe in karma..i believe treat others the way you want to be treated...I also believe in Reincarnation, and Past life regression. Because of my Native American heritage as well (Cherokee and Sioux on my mothers side) I also believe in animal totems, and spirits. I have been told by a Medicine man/Shaman on a Sioux Reservation in Canada where my mother lives that I have a Great Grey Wolf spirit, and thats why I am such a fighter, and survivor. I am very protective over those closest to me, and will fight to the death protecting whats MINE! I am also very loyal, and will always be your best friend as long as you show me that you are worthy. I believe in dream catchers, and Native HEALING. I have a tribal Wolf tattoo, and many people who know nothing about me have told me that my eyes look like Wolf's Eyes! I want to be a mother someday, and hopefully have atleast 1 boy and 1 girl. I'm not permanent on a girls name, but for the boy, his name will be Logan..because thats my most favorite Xmen character, and I have ALWAYS loved the name Logan!"

I am an intellectual looking for someone who can challenge me mentally, in addition to someone who can help me relax. I tend to be wound a little tight sometimes and need reminders (and/or glasses of wine) to help me unwind. Activities-I love anything with the water (beach, swimming, kayaking, tubing). I love to host get-togethers at my house and have dinner parties. I am passionate about cooking and can whip up just about anything. I also love baseball (GO BOSOX), am a bit less enthusiastic about football (but GO Pats anyway), and I actually really enjoy hockey! No, I don't know all the rules of these sports, but I'll cheer anyway :) If you haven't already guessed it, I engage in polyamorous relationships (also called ethical/responsible/consensual non-monogamy) and am NOT looking for merely casual sex...see definition of ""Swinger"" for that lifestyle. I have been with my primary partner for 6.5 years and we are strong and stable and find that we are most happy when we grant ourselves the freedom to live this lifestyle. (Sidenote--he does not engage in poly relationships but absolutely supports my desire to do so...in the event that you should want to be with me, he doesn't tag along). In the past, I have enjoyed being involved in a triad (me being in a relationship with a married couple); I greatly enjoyed doing so. Currently, I'm trying to leave my heart open and welcome a worthy person (male or female) or couple into it, regardless of a specific configuration. So, as long as you're okay with me maintaining my primary relationship and we have a solid connection, I think the possibilities are endless. I can be a little shy, especially due to my unique relationship style, so I tend to chicken out of reaching out to anyone on here (since I usually assume that the typical ""single"" listed people wouldn't be interested in my lifestyle). So, if you're at all interested, feel free to message me, I'd love to hear from you :) Lastly, I'm aware of the vague photo I've posted. I am not ""out"" to many friends and family and would prefer to keep it that way, at least for the time being. I am also a professional and am deeply involved in our community and don't want any mishaps. But, I have more pictures to share and am willing to do so if I think we have a connection. :)"

I'm really looking for someone who I can share stories and fun adventures with, travel with, cook with, and learn more about the world with.

I graduated from college in May and just started my professional life. I just returned to Boston from a short time in Florida. I love to laugh and to be with people. I'm one of those people who smile at strangers, and get weird looks back. I guess its from growing up in a small town, but Bostonians just don't get it. I usually like to be doing something, but I also have my days where I sit around and do nothing. I'm not sure what else to put, but I'm open to talking about anything. I love driving, and I miss my car incredibly while I'm in the city. I'm becoming more and more a Bruins fan, and my roommate and I love watching games together. I have three tattoos and find them very addicting. I love hearing stories about other peoples tattoos, also I love reading. I hate not having a book going. Sometimes it gets hard when I have a lot going on with school, but I always try and make some time for a book I'm pretty blunt, which some people don't like. But I think its better to be told the truth than be lied to. At least, I'd rather be told the truth than be lied to, so I try and project that. I feel I am very mature for my age, at least more mature than my peers. I have studied abroad twice, once when I was 16 to New Zealand and once when I was 20 to Spain. I love traveling, but I do miss the people closest to me when I do. I wish I could bring everyone with me when I travel so I could share the experience. Sharing pictures just isn't the same. Bucket list: take chances. tell the truth. date someone totally wrong for you. say no. spend all your cash. get to know someone random. be random. say i love you. sing out loud. laugh at stupid jokes. cry. apologize. tell someone how much they mean to you. tell a jerk what you think. laugh till your stomach hurts. live life. regret nothing Beautiful music gives me goose bumps I make lots of lists"

I made this site because it was recommended to me by one of my friends who met her boyfriend on here. I'm looking for friends and to see whatever may come out of that if more.

I moved away with my mom and sister to my hometown (if you want to know, you can ask) after they split and my sister and I finished high school in our hometown. I decided in life that I want to settle down and live in SC but I also decided I would start off college where I live now. So no, I'm not in SC at the moment. Why does my profile say I live in SC? Because I find it pointless to meet someone here when I plan on moving in the near future.. Whenever that may be. Ground rules: I won't respond to you if you ask me questions I already answered. I won't expound to you if you didn't read my profile and its clear to me you didn't. But one thing I will accept, which most people hate.. Is, if you want to message me and say hi.. And only hi, I won't be rude and get mad you didn't write much. I get lazy sometimes too and you don't always know what to say to someone. A few facts about myself: Yes, I'm bisexual. I don't prefer one sex over the other. I'm an identical twin, I'm older by 5 minutes. I'm very much a country girl. I love my country music.. Although it isn't all I like. I've been in love once & love the feeling of being in love. I'm obsessed with my Xbox.. Although I share an account with my sister which sometimes sucks, but she hardly plays. I love dancing.

I really like to travel and taking random road trips. I've driven through most of the country, and driven to Canada twice. Planning a trip to South America for sometime next year hopefully, and after that I really want to go to Europe. So basically, I want to be a globe trekker. Different cultures and languages fascinate me. I like the outdoors, camping, hiking, stuff like that, but I'm definitely more of a city girl, and I really enjoy the luxury of indoor plumbing and being clean, so 3 days outdoors is my limit, ha! Also, I hate bugs. Oh, I'm also a HUGE Simpsons fan. Seasons 1-12 mostly. I probably know more Simpsons trivia than any normal person should admit to...Futurama also cracks me up, and a slew of other TV shows, but rather not name them cause this is already long enough."

I believe I am a goddess and should be treated as such but in return this mortal man can become my king and reap all the benefits of the love and desire of a goddess, what can I say I'm a sucker for Ancient Rome. This man should not be afraid to share his thoughts and dreams as well as concerns. I'm the kind of woman who wants the harsh truth not a sweet lie.

I'm very much in touch with my inner child and that's why I love being a mom, I get to still do all the cool things I did when I was a kid and all the stuff I didn't. I want a strong teddy bear. Very masculine but so tender with words and touch for me and his/my children. A caring, highly affectionate, compassionate, loving, funny, youthful man one to grow young with me.

I love to learn new things and meet new people. I believe that in order to be a well rounded intelligent person, you need to converse with others and listen to them.

He also is not necessarily a one person kind of cat. He will sit and cuddle with anyone in my family. I was a photography student, I am an artist, however please don't ask me to critique you. I hate giving reviews that are not true because I am afraid of hurting peoples feelings. I went to an amazing art school and know what worthwhile art looks like. I have made a few enemies in my past because I was trying to help them become better artists and they were so resistant that I ended up telling them what they are producing is shit. This is why I will not critique you. I don't like being mean, but I will not lie. Critiquing others is hard to do when you dont like to to do either of those things. The thing I hate the most are people who are desperate. I loathe getting typical pick up lines. I don't like to mess around, if I don't like you I will not talk to you, sorry. While it is not the most important thing, I have to be at least slightly physically attracted to you. Some people would say I am a bitch because of this side of my personality, but I know what I want and I wont waste others time leading them on. Aside from all that harshness, I am a very caring, compassionate person. My friends are treated like gold. I feel that your close friends are the next best thing you have to family. I am a country girl at heart. I will do anything for my friends, family and those I love. But with that said, it takes a lot to get to that level. Oh and I really love to talk..."

I am a huge fan of movies, learning new things, Miami Hurricanes Fan, studying...especially languages (I am fluent in English and Spanish). Besides movies, I enjoy reading, staying in shape, and going out to explore. I am looking to make some new friends and expand my social circle. I am looking for someone who is daring, playful and adventurous and who will balance me.

I wanted to be different, though maybe sometimes, different means weird; but it could also mean unique. So read along to your heart's content and tell me what you think. Imagine a place where randomness is flowing freely, inspiration to think outside the box is abundant, and the ground is shaking because of down-to-earth qualities combine: then you get a nurturing best friend, a romantic dork, a spontaneous kid-at-heart, a rational conversationalist, an open-minded over-achiever and a beautiful soul all rolled into one gigantic crepe, seemingly plain on the outside but bursting with flavor on the inside. I will admit I listed down everything I wanted to write on here to pinpoint exactly who I am and maybe even what I am looking for. I was even this close to quoting lines from select songs and movies to try and get my message through. Then I realized, it's not about finding the ""one-and-only"", it's being honest with who you are and respecting the person who you want to be with. It's about spending time with someone who you may or may not have a lot in common with, yet not scared to learn new things and appreciate the differences about them as well. It's about meeting someone who will be willing to do extraordinary things with you and make you feel comfortable in your own skin no matter what. Finding someone who will take you by the hand and travel through madness with you. It's being happy with your crazy sense of humor, fun-filled surprises, ridiculous wit, adorable dorkiness, flaming ambition and never-ending motivation. Knowing you compliment and complement each other. To love and be loved for being who you are and not some concocted image of who you want that person to be. It's about trusting a genuine person, being a listener and to listen, being a playful yet sensitive tease, and a flaw accepting best friend. Then you won't just ""find"" a way into that person's heart; you actually want to pave and run and dig and swim and jump to ends to be with that person and then win their heart. please don't hesitate to ask me anything :)"

As for personality, I like individuals who are down-to-earth, humble, caring and altruistic (the list could go on). For a long-term partner, she/he'd have to be assertive, decisive and loyal. I know my expectations might seem very daunting, it's definitely a challenge. Hopefully you're up for it! Reflecting back, almost ever sentence starts with ""I"" so my apologies for talking about myself so much. Message me, I'd like to get to know you =) and thanks for taking the time to read this."

I created a profile to teach you how to make your lady friend cum from oral! You're welcome! Let's begin by saying, gay men and lesbians need not read further. The lesbians know what they are doing and the gay men don't want to be between a woman's legs unless he is a wedding dress designer taking measurements. However, lesbians and straight women who read this are more than welcome to message me if I left something out. Alright, let's get started! First of all, why even read about pleasing a woman through clitoral stimulation? If you are a man who is still selfish and would prefer to just fast forward to the part when YOU cum, then this isn't for you. I am addressing the men who care, but who are using ""techniques"" that the ladies are too nice to tell you are just terrible. So I will tell you for her. First of all-- We are not going to be immediately aroused. You are, we know. But you go from not aroused to very hard in a matter of 10 seconds and you are ready to go! We take a bit more to catch up. So when you begin, DO NOT just go right for the clit. There are 2 reasons for this. #1-- It isn't sensitive yet. It is as if you are licking my arm. Why spend time there if it isn't having the desired effect? #2-- There are other areas near by that we want you to lick and kiss and rub first. Our inner thighs and and inch or so above our clit are very close to our pussy. These are 2 great places to start. Assuming of course she is waxed or shaved. If it is very hairy there, then I don't know what to tell you. Have you ever had a girl blow you and she doesn't go right for your cock? It makes it more intense right? Because she is close to it, but not licking or sucking your actual cock yet. She is teasing you. You like it! Then when she DOES go for your cock, you are beyond horny and even harder and REALLY ready for the blow job! We are the same. Get close but don't touch it right away. After those 2 areas had some attention (not forever, just a minute or so), then you move a little closer. (wishing I could insert a diagram right here). The outer lips, the part that in porn the girl spreads open so you can see up close, are going to want some time being licked and teased too. Ordinarily this area is not sexually sensitive but because we know you are going to lick our clit soon, licking here drives us crazy and will really make us wet. PROFILE IN PROGRESS. I am adding more in the next couple hours."

Hope that doesn't blow you over or sound too serious because I can be the most fun-loving kind funny guy in person but will use this space to filter out 99% of you so as not to waste your time or mine. I love exploring the city and going out to eat at nice restaurants almost every night. I enjoy working out and keeping in shape. From my pictures a few months ago, I look pretty thin; but I recently hired a personal trainer to help me build 10 pounds of muscle each month for sixth months. I'm also in the process of taking kung fu classes and how to harness chi energy. Basically, I'm always working on improving myself and am never going to get content there is always a better way to become a better person. Oh yea, also I'm into trantic sex. Oh, also, When I do something I like to go all out and never do a half-ass job. ;) I'm an over-exceller in everything that I do, otherwise why do it? This includes a relationship too. I'm really passionate about my work, I own my own businesses and am an entrepreneur, working mostly from my home office. I can re-locate and travel any time I want and am looking for a partner who, eventually, can feel safe relocating which *may* entail quitting her job (when she feels secure enough), and enjoying her time with her partner while treating the world like her/our personal playground. Life is meant to explore the world and have fun. When I find the right one, I will be wholeheartedly loyal and just seek the dedicated partner to enjoy life and spend my free time with. I am looking for someone who can be girlfriend-material with a sweet spot balance of closeness and at the same time allowing the other partner their independence. I do not want to rush anything in the beginning but you should know up front where it is headed. The perfect partner is one who is mostly carefree/easy-going, smiles, laughs a lot and creates very little to no drama. Looking for that happy go lucky girl. You may have your own interests and hobbies but can settle down and join her man and his lifestyle. Although the time frame is not set in stone, I can invision that eventually (after 3 months or so of good chemistry), would like to move in with their partner (me). Looking for my partner to move in to a luxury apartment in a perfect location in New York City or Miami Beach. I dont want to live with my male friends or strangers as roommates, but want to split the rent with the right partner. I can pay 2/3 of the rent if you can pitch in 1/3. I Would love to use our place to occassionally throw parties at our place or fly in and entertain friends or family, I don't like living in cramped spaces, or substandard living conditions. I'm not a big party animal, and I'm not addicted to bars and clubs. Staying out late every now and then (two or three times a month) for a special night out is awesome! But all in moderation. Going out drinking and dancing and having a guy grind up against you sweating on you every thursday friday and saturday night is really draining and tiring, right girls?!! It's also aging you quicker than you realize and creating bags under your eyes to become permanent.! Besides, many of you girls regret to remember going home with some random guy you just met at the end of a night of too much drinking. That's totally not the type of girl I'd like to marry or be in a long-term relationship with, and is a recipe for family court, child support, and emotional drama for 18 years god-forbid an accident happens. OK I'd rather be extremely picky than waste your time or mine. Talk to me and you'll get to know my fun-loving personality ;)"

I actually have social skills (I'm still awkward at times, but I have them). I also have philosopher, redneck, party animal, commedian, and stoner mixed in for some flavor. I'm pretty laid back and easy to get a long with, though when I get excited about something, I overflow with energy. Basically, I'm me, take it or leave it. What I like: Having a good time. That can encompass a lot, from playing video games, to hanging out with friends playing board games, to going shooting, going to a party, or just reading a book. I love yo laugh and make others laugh. Fair warning though, I have a screwed up sense of humor. I love being around people most of the time, but every now and then, I just need some space to collect my thoughts and re-center myself. What I dislike: Unnecessary drama. Some times it needs to happen to get things done, but most of the time, you just need to let go and walk away. People who interfere in others lives. As long as someone isn't hurting others or impeding their way of life, let them live how they want. Dishonesty. I try to live an honest and open life, and expect others to do the same. I won't begrudge you your secrets though. We all have them. What I'm looking for: My ultimate goal is to find a long term relationship, but friends, dating, or some no strings attached fun is fine too if that's what you're interested in.

I like a wide variety of music. I like going to hear live music as well. I play a few musical instruments, but mostly it's just something I tinker with. I enjoy volunteering, biking, exploring the sites, hiking in the mountains, floating the river, golfing, the gym, and all sorts of other activities. I was a swimmer and I actually received a few scholarships to swim in college when i was younger. I served my country in the Navy and I am now in the Navy Reserves. I love my job! I have been fortunate to find something that I am truly happy doing. I graduated from the University of Oklahoma so I am passionate about my team! I love the Red Sox, Nats, Caps, and the Cowboys (might be the wrong thing to say here, but a little competition can be fun too... lol!) I am close with my family and friends. I am a little shy at first, but I warm up pretty quickly and I end up being fairly outgoing and talkative. I have a good sense of humor and that I am witty. I am sarcastic at times, and feel like if I can dish it out, I should be able to take it. I will laugh at some of the oddest things and can be downright goofy. I am honest and loyal, and I expect the same in return. I would like someone to show me around, or maybe another recent transplant who I can go exploring with. I like to try new restaurants and bars. I also like to travel and I have been fortunate enough to go some pretty cool places. There are so many places left to go. Travel is generally more fun when you have someone to share it with."

I'm a geek, proud of it, and I have no shame. I play video games, I keep up with the current trends of said games and critique the quality of them, privately or with friends. I'm blunt, and get right to the point. I have little time for sugar coating or beating around the bush, it's just pointless. I am honest with whomever I am in relations with and they definitely know it. However, with that being said, I am a very loyal person and if you are involved in my life, you will definitely be an active part of it. Okay, time for the generic stuff...I'm 22, living in Grand Rapids, I have two jobs, a car, and a home with two roommates, as well as a dog and two cats. Back to self, I am quirky, energetic, and outgoing, however, with that said, I am also reserved, sometimes shy, and unfocused. I am two different ends of the spectrum, all wrapped into one. Weird, I know, but it's just how I am. Okay, couple more things, I like to sing, even though I'm not great at it, music is important to me, I'm a romantic comedy/horror type of guy, as well as more masculine then feminine. Alright, enough of my jabber. That's me in a nut shell, definitely not enough room to sum myself up in such a small space, but, I feel as if it will suffice. :)"

Though I do find astrology interesting in a mythological sense, I do not think it is a basis for judging character or compatibility. It just so happens I'm a Pisces, and the description fits me perfectly. So for those not familiar with the Pisces personality: I am of the artistic persuasion, specifically the musical arts. I am calm, easy going, and sensitive concerning myself and others. I am a good listener, patient, understanding, and I rarely judge others. On the other hand, I can be spacey, introverted, and indecisive. Important dates can escape me; I don't do well in large social situations; I forget to do important things; sometimes I let people down without meaning to. That all being said, when I let people down, I do everything I can to acknowledge my mistake, learn from it, and make things right."

I would consider myself to be an outgoing person with a great sense of humor. I am not afraid to try something new and I am always looking to have a good time. I take friendship seriously, as well as honesty. I'm a firm believer that without trust, its really hard to build a relationship with someone, even if it is just as friends. I am a very forgiving person, but I will never forget. I try to learn from all life experiences and I have definitely learned never to take anything for granted. I never take anything for granted, and firmly believe that there is a reason for everything, whether it is good or bad. I love meeting new people, and I am always up for a wonderful conversation. I try to look at things in the best way possible, because I have realized pessimism gets you nowhere. Just like anyone, I have my moments when I want to go out and have a good time, but I also like those times when I can just sit around and relax inside with a good book, or with a few good friends. I've also learned that I have to work for what I want most in life, because nothing is going to be handed to me on a silver platter. Life is not easy, but it is what you make of it. I believe that what doesnt kill you, will only make you stronger. Im not perfect, and I know that not everyone will like me, but honestly i could care less. I love my friends and I my family, and in the end, that's really all that matters. Even though I'm gay, I don't let that fact define who I am as a person. I'm pretty easy-going when it comes to going out and doing something. I can have fun doing whatever as long as I have someone fun to do it with. I am very open, honest, sincere and caring. In my free time, I love hanging out with my friends. We have a great time doing just about anything! I also enjoy reading, writing, and listening to music. Oh, and just a couple years ago, I was introduced to the joys of camping! So if you like camping also, we'll get along just fine! I am Encouraging, Humorous, and Dedicated"

I've recently moved back to the South Florida area and definitely looking for some good friends (the least) and even that special lady. Not here for drama or looking for booty calls, because it's just not me. And just cause one/many jerks broke your heart or played you, don't think every man is out to do the same. So don't ever use your past to put up walls as it will drive away men with heart, and then you end up with more jerks.. (see the viscous circle where women claim they never meet any good men? lol) People describe me as ambitious, off the wall, unpredictable and exotic due to my Indian and Caribbean heritage. My hobbies include learning to cook Italian, Caribbean, and Asian food, making mouth-watering bbq's, learning to become a better dancer, and someday learning to play the guitar. One of my greatest passions is LIVE music!!! I've worked in the entertainment industry and still do so occasionally as a sound engineer and guest DJ/Mixer. My unique talent is into doing remixes/blends of dance, top 40, pop, reggae etc. Not much of a TV person, but love Bar Rescue, Shipwreck Men, Flying Wild Alaska, Gold Rush, Burn Notice, Royal Pains. Weekend getaways to another city are simply awesome!! No fixed route, just go wherever curiosity and adventure takes me. Almost everything I do revolves around the theory of living every single day as though it's our last one, and enjoy life to it's fullest. I love simplicity and a simple girl. I'm not on here just looking for a date, but for someone who I can connect with, on so many different levels. For example, someone who *sneakily* puts the a/c on 60 and then claim they feel cold, just for extra snuggling :), or someone who actually likes spending time with the person they love. I really prefer a non-smoker, and definitely a drug-free person. Yeah If you're a fun girl who's into this type of stuff, send me a message and we can go from there."

I suppose maturity and mutual respect is something I highly value. The most important thing in life is to respect other people. I always strive to see the best in other people, and just becuase its hard, doesn't mean I stop trying. Most people I find will try to work on themselves only one time a year, new years, when they make new year's resolutions. Why is that the only time you can possibly change yourself? Why can't you do the same thing in July that you do in the beginning of January? What's more, is that people will fail on their resolutions, and afterwards just give up.

So you think all the good ones are taken or gay â well you're probably right... but I think I'm a pretty good option considering what's left over. I'm recently separated and looking to casually connect and share some good times with new and interesting people. It was difficult making my mixed marriage work â I was human and she was Klingon, but I've grown and developed from the experience. I already come fully relationship trained, I can see the mess that is invisible to most men, and can easily cope with estrogen flare-ups. I know how to put on my Mr. Fixit hat if required, just lend a sympathetic ear or if all else fails fetch the wine and Haagen-Dazs. If you've had a bad day I'll try to make you laugh, and if that guy keeps peeking through your window, I'll punch him in the throat. I also understand you have poor circulation and cold feet. No problem, I generate more heat than Fukushima to keep those footsies warm through our bone-chilling winters. A little more about me - I'm an optimist that loves to enjoy the finer things in life and to embark on new adventures. I currently work in high-tech after leaving a satisfying career being the guy Cosmo tests all their sex tips on; my perineum was getting a little worn out. In my spare time I help Chuck Norris perfect his roundhouse kicks and spend a lot of time bringing sexy back. I'd rather play sports than watch them. I'm a great conversationalist and am comfortable discussing everything from the pros and cons of the bachelorette extending an invite to the fantasy suite to whether the monarchy is an irrelevant anachronism. I'm looking for someone who doesn't take life too seriously, has something interesting to say and is low maintenance but can still get glammed up for the special occasions. Now you're probably thinking, âgreat â but how do I know you're not psycho?â Well, according to Oprah I pass most litmus tests for being trustworthy. I have a tight group of long-term buddies, I have a good relationship with my mother and have never mistreated small animals (well except for Fluffy, but I was 5 and I didn't know you had to poke holes in the box). So what are you waiting for? Drop me a line, say hello, you can ask me a question or ask for movie reviews or fashion advice - I'm way better than Siri. You don't want to end up at a restaurant seeing me with some other woman who's having the time of her life, while you're stuck with some deadbeat bragging about his promotion to senior burger flipper and is saving up to get the last two letters of his name tattooed on his forearm."

And I believe we are all at our best when we are ourselves. I'll be your advocate and your biggest fan. I'll open the door for you, walk on the street side of the sidewalk and walk one step below you on stairs, my mother took raising her sons as gentlemen very seriously.

I have little drama, plus I avoid people with drama. I speak my mind most of the time, which can come out bluntly, though I know when to keep things diplomatic. I try not to let others get in my way or bring me down. Yet if someone is being dumb, especially a drama queen I will make sure they know how I feel. To my friends I can be either one of two persona. I can have a quick wit or can be the serious anchor for wisdom and advice. I love to relax. I do that by reading books or news articles about space exploration, NASA, sciences, and casually playing computer games. I admit I am a geek, not a nerd. I can quote Star Trek, and Star Wars. When my friends text me about heading to Tully's, party, gym or whatever I often join them. If nothing is going on I enjoy the day at home. I wear plain practical clothing, khaki cargo pants, plain shirts with no writing/symbols and work boots. Also one key bit to my personality is I tend to always influence my surroundings. If my room/house/car/whatever does not suit my needs. I change it to fit my will. Forgot to mention I can be a bit too logical at times too... If I have not been on in a while and you're interested in chatting, just send me a message. My phone will notify me. Please put in more effort than just saying hey. A simple question or something a little more involved will do. No paragraph is needed. Since this site does not have a ""what I am looking for"" section I will add it!!! What I am looking for is a woman who is intelligent, independent and has a mind similar to mine. (Honestly that mind bit seems to be hard to find) I am not looking for a hot piece of a**. More of a long term that could turn into a serious relationship. If that serious part scares you, then I'm sorry, your not for me at the moment. Also, if your not interested in that, but still think I'm as awesome as I am, a friendship is always possible."

There is a reason for this, and that reason is because of my past. I have been leaniant in the past about certain things, and in response to that I was deceived and betrayed. No more though, I am constricting certain areas and being more careful in whom I date. As for friendship, you don't have to change anything to be my friend, be yourself around me. Religious prefrence does not mater here, I will respect what you believe, but I will not be converted. And besides, I like to have CIVILIZED talks about what I believe and why I believe it. And as a friend our conflicting interests are not going to make a division (unlike in a relationship, when there is devision between the mother and father because of religious belief it affects the children negatively. Which is why the mother and father should have correlating beliefs)."

Here's the inside scoop... Originally from Hamilton, I moved here four years ago and currently work at T.G.H. Working in the medical field has had a major impact on my outlook on life. ""Never take your health for granted"" it is a true gift to have your health. Considering the current weather, you're more likely to find me outdoors playing soccer or just trying to enjoy the weather as much as possible. I'm a huge fan of food; love cooking and I would say I'm quite skilled in the kitchen. There are a few things I find intriguing. 1) Cultures, ideally I would like to find somebody who has that sort of itch as well. I believe going around the city attending events, experiencing different cultures helps an individual grow and gain knowledge; I like the idea of being a people's person. 2) Adventure, there is so much out there to see and do, so I have made this plan for myself and my future ""lady friend"" to travel a lot in the next five years, I relish the idea of taking my girlfriend on a trip into the jungles of South America or the Pyramids in Egypt. These are some goals of mine that I want to achieve before starting a family. (I'm not Indiana Jones, but you do have to admit his cool guy). To sum this profile up and hopefully spark your interest, I'm laid back, and I enjoy an ice cream on a Sunday. Care to join me? Lol. My idea of night in: cooking a beautiful meal, sharing a bottle of wine, and watching a fun scary movie. My Idea of a night out, drink on a patio do a little people watching or go see a play/movie, catch an event/show around town. I am looking for someone who wants to find cool niche place not clubbing. I'm a spontaneous adventurer, and it's something I'm looking for in a girl as well (lets go to Montreal for the weekend?). I'm a straight shooter, I say what's on my mind, and I'm always down for a stimulating conversation or a healthy argument, lol. Having differences in a relationship is important, after all, they're a work in progress, nobody said a relationship is easy. I have fears, flaws and many strengths, just like everyone else. I'm lots of fun and have a good outlook on life. P.S This profile is just the tip of the iceberg."

I have a burning passion for electronic music, but love the arts in general. Like I really do have a wide interest in music, but the past few years, I've been CONSUMED by electronic.

I like going out and having a good time at the club and hearing DJs but I'm just as happy to stay home and chill with homies. Jewish by culture, but not by religion. Instead I've been very interested in taoism and karma as it pertains to everyday life. I also love movies and TV, but I like them because I can analyze them and I pick up on sorts of crazy shit and I like to talk about all of this stuff with my friends. A lively debate about the intricacies of the different styles of house music or the symbolism behind nathanial hawthorne's short stories. Total nerd in that regard. Amongst friends I can be the loudmouth asshole but it's always in good fun and I love making people laugh and it makes me feel good to do that, so I do it a lot! Basically, I love culture and analyzing it and embracing it and it's corny, but it brings us together as people and helps us find meaning in life.

Anger seems to be rampant in men I have known and I have never understood why. I am very calm and prefer to take the time to enjoy life; after all, I only get one shot. I am very compassionate and do not mind helping others out, as long as I am not taken advantage of, which has happened countless times. This also relates back to my pessimistic view of things, but nonetheless, I am still able and helping. I feel that I am very responsible.

No one ever expects some quiet guy to totally disarm you with some smartass remark. And that's what I do best. I put all of my energy into things I actually feel passionate about - the first being music. Writing, playing, recording, I am always going one step further, so as much as I don't try in the ""working man's world,"" ambition means a lot to me. I'm blunt, and if things don't interest me, I'll say so. I have sharp opinions, and I like it when others do too. I also try hard to feel comfortable, to have a space to relax and get away from the pressures of the ding dang world. That space is better shared with others, though things can get less productive that way. I put all of my heart into relationships, whether its with a cat or my partner of many years, and though I warm slowly to friendship, I have the common man's best weapon always ready to break the ice: a sense of humor. I currently have a primary partner, and we have explored openness in the past in various ways. I think there is still more to be explored, and I'm interested to see whats out there."

I want to become close to different types of people. If we have similar ideas we can build closeness through such eccentricity, and if we have clashing ideas we can learn much from our battles. I prefer to speak with those who have been received negatively by the culture they were raised in. Since they were different, they were attacked by the majority, thus their constant need to defend themselves made them strong. Perfectibility is a very important thing in my life. I define it as the process of self-polishing without a determined goal. That means that I am always seeking better conclusions and methods for everything and applying what I learn to my daily life. I always wear black. Because black is the absence of light. Black lets you know that you will not see my true colors with your senses. You have to use your mind to perceive the light of my soul through my words, yet the light of my actions is much more powerful, like explosions of stars. My meaning shall be clear to you with interaction, but what I look like means nothing, just like the universe means nothing without light-emanating stars. Many would think of me as a man of renunciation because I strive for a higher world, I want to fly further and higher than all men of affirmation, thus, I throw away much that would encumber my flight, including not a little that I esteem and like; I sacrifice it to my desire for the heights. I approach life ascetically. I have disciplined myself to center my time into what I deem to be important. Thus, I learn languages and read literature and philosophy every day. I scrutinize my behavior severely. I do not tolerate myself doing something which I deem unethical; however, I do not hold others to the same standards that I hold myself given that ethics are a personal choice."

I like comic books and science fiction, and I'm not afraid to admit it to people. I have tattoos, I like a girl that can really wear a big hat. My favorite kind of weather is overcast. I have very blue eyes. I can start a fire with a couple sticks and some rope. I'm very clumsy. I'm afraid of the doctor's office. In my opinion, the best sandwich in the world comes from Bay Cities. Thats a rough overview of me as a person."

""NOAH"" Sign; Aries; Due to the fact that Aries likes enthusiasm coupled with aggressive and passionate behavior. They need a mate who has a sense of adventure, the out-going type who is independent. Remember that Aries does everything in a hurried fashion, like 90 miles per hour, and may fall in love at first sight. What will continue to attract an Aries is a partner who will create a challenge for them, keeping things fresh, exciting and able to hold their interest. Positives: Decisive, original, confident, resourceful, adaptable, valiant, passionate. Negatives: Imperious, tyrannical, arrogant, tactless, hotheaded, critical, dogmatic. Aries Love Traits * Arians have a strong sense of romance. * They are very possessive of their loved ones and are prone to jealousy. * They are highly expressive in love and are not the ones to hold back their feelings. * Arians are very faithful to their loved ones and do not go straying after other people once they find their match. * They love spontaneity in a relation. * Since they are stubborn in their demands, they tend to dominate in a relation. * Arians are highly egoistic in nature and always have the individualism factors predominant. And so two Arians normally do not make up good match. However, they can strike out a harmony in case both are ready to compromise a bit.

You dig? I enjoy a nice equilibrium. A pleasant, balance of hatred for society and love of the security I create for my self within it. In the last couple years, my work has become my life but, at least once a day, I stop, listen to the ambient sounds around me, focus on my breathing for a moment and slip into a contemplative trance. I never forget to appreciate the infinity of the moment. As above, so below. In high school I was one of those kids who never showed up to class. I was riding the metro to Seattle with my friends to go experience the big city or I was hanging out at a special river spot I knew about with hippies and learning all about how I didn't want to end up. All of this in a blurry haze of psychedelics, adolescent naievity, and built up creativity. To this day, I maintain the perspective on life I had in my more youthful years. Only now, I appreciate it even more. I've been so focused on my career for the last couple years, I'm ready to slow down again and enjoy being young while it lasts. I decided to move to Auburn a couple years ago and I unfortunately don't meet many interesting girls around here. What a bummer it has been. So, I have decided to give this a try. I'm open to serious relationships or not so serious relationships. I'm just kind of going with the flow. I know what I want and I will seize the opportunity when it presents it's self. I love music. I play guitar and a little drums. I'm renting a house just because of the huge jam space down stairs! I'm also getting back into other art forms. I like riding dirt bikes. I have two. I love snowboarding and driving in the snow as much as possible during the winter. I'm not really into the bar scene anymore but, I do frequent the little dive bar down the street from my house. I prefer to actually go out and do stuff. I'm into a lot of esoteric things. I've spent a lot of time contemplating and educating my self a little bit in a great deal of subjects. I can be incredibly difficult to read in person. My closest long time friends will attest to this. There is no way anyone will even come close to getting the gist of who I am on this site but, I will make a considerable effort to help you along."

I am shy but outgoing, timid but strong, a loner but loves to be around people. It all depends on who I am with and how familiar or comfortable that I am with them. I am very educated, not necessarily from a collegiate accomplishment level as I am street wise and in tune with my surroundings, making me more often comfortable than anxious. I have spent a lot of time alone for the last few years,because I took a good look and did not like who I saw anymore so I took the time out to get to know myself and change those values and attitudes I did not like and made sure the change was what is me.had more adventures than I sometimes can remember, but they have all been educational and I am glad they happened and I experienced them. I think confidence is the greatest asset a person can have, both in themselves and in the environment around them. I like a woman who has achieved self actualization, that is not dwelling on what happened way back when but what could happen today or tomorrow. Those that dwell in the past are not around me very long, I spot them from miles and run fast. I enjoy dancing, great conversation, intelligence, not necessarily from the academic side, but common sense and the ability to think through things. I like a woman that can carry a conversation and is not afraid to learn or to teach for that matter. I want it all and will not settle for less, but at the same time, want that person that can stop and smell the roses and appreciate the time he has on this earth, knowing it is not forever. I also like the woman that is not looking to get married as the only reason to meet, but someone that is looking for a deep friendship."

I am 20 not 21 and I am adopted and have been disowned from my family because I am gay. My father owns his own business in pa which is where I am originally from and I quit the business when my family disowned me last year. I moved to Georgia and have heenbdown here for a year and ur has been treating me well except for the guys I have been dating, they either cheat, lie, or hit me. So now its hard to find a guyvwho isntbjust interested in my ass it calls me a charity case. I did sports in high school: swimming, volleyball, cheerleading I loved it. I had joint enrollment when I was in high school and for those who don't know what that is it means I'm also in college and taking college courses. I graduated with my associates degree in business management and administration and I'm currently in medical school getting my MA degree. A little more about myself I was a dancer and when I say dance I used to stripand I was a go go boy I used to do drag shows. I'm a well rounded individual.

I am a very passionate individual and love to laugh and meet new people.

Sardonicism aside, I tend to care either too much or too little about things in general. When it comes to aesthetics, the former is more true. I'm rather obsessed with finding beauty in things and the idea of perfection in and of itself, despite having a difficult time keeping my mind from running off into the scary midnight woods.

Long/boring story short... I was caught collecting massive amounts of acorns. I'm definitely not as serious as my tone would suggest in my writings here. I guess I just find it hard to be personal with a web page directed at no one specific. I think the closest example of my favorite humor would be the life of Liz Lemon. I'm really adventurous, I tend to take the option that is most promising to surprise me. I'm super accepting, I keep an open mind about everything and everyone or at least try to. I'd say I'm not without my flaws but I'm really well rounded overall, jack of all trades master of one or two :P I took a personality test that says I am INFP, I took another more recently that says I'm ENTJ which is pretty different so maybe I've been changing lately? Maybe the tests are different? I generally care about humanity. I make it my goal to prevent senseless waste, inconvenience, and suffering even with the littlest of my actions. Agape love is the most important thing in the world. I'm not your typical pacifist though. Still I try my hardest to love everyone as my neighbor. I just realize some sacrifices need to be made in certain situations. Sometimes I get really into my intellectual pursuits but I'm confident I have a great mix of being socially adept and nerdy depending on what the occasion calls for. Events that have changed my life: -Moving in middle school -Various Christian Camps (Just like your typical summer camp... but centered around God) -Humanitarian Relief trip to Haiti -Being an idiot with drugs/alcohol in my teens -Joining a fraternity (No I wasn't hazed) -Being ""Academically Dismissed"" from RPI So about God and I. I have my own special relationship with God that happens to fall under Christianity. I'm not a believer in ""dogma"", aka) I don't believe things because people told me so. This applies both to the church and encountering random people spewing random ""fact"". My religious views are pretty academic in the sense that I reason through what I read of the Bible and occasionally like to talk philosophically/debate points of view. I read the Bible and interpret what it's saying for myself some of it is meant to be taken literally and some of it is meant to be allegorical (A parallel story) I don't believe in all of the Bible literally because: it was written by man (some even generations after Jesus died), the Gospels don't entirely agree with each other (slight contradictions between accounts), language in itself is ambiguous and on top of that was translated from Greek or Aramaic. In short I believe the Bible means whatever the goodness in your heart tells you it means. Nothing more nothing less. I incorporate my spirituality pretty seamlessly as my being of a Physicist, so where my knowledge of the possibilities in physics and possibilities of God meet creates some very specific beliefs which I think are pretty interesting. If you're interested please, I'd love to talk about it. If this turns you away... probably for the best. I'm not looking to attract close-minded people. I don't let the small things bother me. You know like saying something that might be somewhat off or could make me look weird or like an asshole. I know I'm a good person and I am who I am so I'm usually not afraid of people taking things the wrong way. I think that people should be self confident enough to not take things offensively all the time. (Matthew 15:13) <--- My interpretation, If you speak with goodness in your heart God will make the best of it. I avoid stereotypes, both in being one and in judging others, though do believe they exist for a reason lol. I suppose a good closing statement, I see my self as a really empathetic person. I see several different view points at once and it's very rewarding to see the big picture. I believe relationships are two way. Sacrifice and compromise are necessary abilities in a partner. If you're selfish or unwilling to accept me for who I am leave right now. I also believe that relationships are meant for bettering one another and giving and receiving support, so you better also be up for that. When I can tell things are bothering those I care about I feel the need to help them. It's almost like I share their pain, so if you're someone that can't talk about their problems it's not going to work. I still do expect someone I'm with to be independent enough as to not NEED me for every little thing in the world. Don't think because I need to help those I care about I'll try to change everything in your life because I'm definitely not controlling."

I grew up in Sweden and moved to California to study when I was 14. Having said that, English is my third language and if you listen carefully enough you may hear that I have a funny accent when I say certain words. Feel free to poke fun of it and I promise I won't be offended. I have grown a pretty thick skin for it by now! Secondly, I'm a geek at heart and it's not just because my favorite sitcom is The Big Bang Theory but because some, OK a lot, of the things in the show can be applied to myself. Nevertheless, while I'm dorky I also know how to be manly! At least I think so. On a more serious note, I'm ambitious, goal-driven, and hard-working. I believe you should be too. My career is my number one priority at the moment. However, I'm looking forward to meeting someone that will change that. I have been told that I'm shy at first and I will admit to it. But I promise I open up easily as long as we get along and click. Patience is a virtue! Lastly, I consider myself adventurous and daring and I have grown an interest for extreme outdoor activities. I went skydiving for the first time in Australia last year and I would love to do it again. Other things I want to try is hang gliding and bungee jumping. And anything else that is made up of two words. I work out a lot because I love to eat! I try to go to the gym at least four times a week and on a good week I will go every day. It will be great if you're active too so that I have a gym partner and we can motivate each other. In conclusion, if you have read up to this point then I think you should message me!"

I would have one of my friends write this to eliminate that, but they'd put all sorts of weird things on here as a joke. I like to think I am a very balanced and adaptable person. Given this quality, my friends are an interesting bunch of people and don't always get along with each other. I know this section is long, but read further and you might find out some things ;-). I'm not artistic at all unless you count martial arts, but find myself drawn to people who are artistic. If you can draw, paint, pretty much create anything resembling something else you have my respect because stick figures are as far as I go. I play video games on and off (what guy doesn't). This is usually branched in Halo Reach atm but does stray off to other games and gaming platforms dependent on the company I am keeping. A few other hobbies I have are collecting bladed weaponry, sunglasses and random dragon paraphernalia. Other prerequisites that I have for geekdom would include that I have (and fall back into from time to time) played Magic the Gathering. I've played WoW and given the right friends could fall back into that as well. Less geeky/nerdy things that I do. I am currently a black belt in two martial arts, wouldn't mind getting another one around my waist. I weight lift and swim at the gym every week. As to why the hell am I here on this site? Well, to say I have been unsuccessful in the dating world would not be quite accurate, because that is not a world I frequent very often. I got my BA in three years, which means I did school non-stop. Those of you who have worked a job while taking school know my torment, those who haven't, the keyword was ""torment"". Now that I'm out of school, why have I not entered the world of dating besides in cyberspace? A few reasons can clearly illuminate the answer for you. I don't like going to clubs, because dancing, much like the drawing and painting mentioned earlier, I posess no skill in. I don't frequent bars for 3 reasons. 1. I can buy a bottle and make my own mixed drinks for the price of two at a bar. 2. My work schedule is all over the place, so the timing of many social events are while I am still at work or just getting off and needing a break. 3. The ladies who frequent the bar don't like my choice in vocabulary (I sound too smart). This is not to be full of myself, just an observation observed and relayed to me via my female friends. That being said, if you are having trouble reading any of the above, we may not mesh well, because I assure you I talk very similarly to how I write. What things might you bring to the table that would increase the chance of us meshing well? Mentally speaking, you don't have to have gone to college, but it couldn't hurt. Just being able to show you have the capacity for good conversation is well enough. I find that people who read a lot have this regardless of the schooling, due to the vocabulary you gain from reading. Physically speaking, you don't need to be an aspiring model, in fact, that may be a detriment because experience has shown they can be high maintenance and more insecure about their bodies then non-aspirers. As long as you are in shape, we're good, I keep myself in shape, so I'm not being a hypocrite, I only want to reap what I sew. Spiritually speaking, I'm Christian, this does not mean you have to be one too. I'm not a bible thumper nor do I even attend organized services. As long as you are trying to be the best ""you"" possible, it doesn't matter if you are buddist, jewish, catholic, agnostic, atheist, etc. Being capable of accepting presents on Xmas would be nice, they're free, take them! :-P Compatibility, probably the most important part. Yes, all of the above have to do with compatibility in some respects, but this gets its own section, deal with it ;-). If you have liked what you read so far, ie. also play halo, don't mind swords hanging on the walls, went through the mental, physical and spiritual and are like ""That's me, what else you got?!"" then you're off to a brillant start. Other miscellaneous things (this list will be added to as time goes on) are as follows. If you're vegetarian, vegan, or some form thereof that I do not know of or would have trouble spelling, I'm probably not your ""one"". I eat meat, a lot, probably more then is healthy, because steak is awesome, all meat combo pizza is amazing and junk food is much needed when I've had a hectic day and don't want to make something. If you are overly emotional or have no affinity for sarcasm, you need not apply, this position is not for you. How do I define ""overly emotional""? If you cry during movies, you're still good, if you cried when you read the 5th book of Harry Potter, I will think its weird, but it happens. Overly emotional is when you cry during every sad part of any tv show you may be watching. This section is already fairly long, and I may add to it later. Its safe to say, that should you be curious about other things, you can always message me. I'm an open book, you just need to read the pages."

Just because your past might be painful doesn't mean you can run from it and not experience the growth it presents. It's the Chinese proverb that says "" there is great opportunity in pain."" I'm okay with your past as long as you are, we all have one and it defines or destroys us. Which side are you on? Ladies, some male candor here, I'm a guy and I know how we think and what we want. If you don't want "" players "" responding to your heartfelt, eloquent profiles, don't post pictures of you taking pictures of yourself in your underwear! You get what you promote, sorry! I appreciate a woman of substance who takes care of herself as much as I do but please leave something to the imagination. I'm looking for a woman who can go from the bar room to the ballroom or boardroom and be all woman in the privacy of her own home. A woman, regardless of formal education who has substance, charm, sophistication, humor, integrity, kindness, passion, passion, passion, for her man, her family and friends, her work, for others. She must be very attractive or at least believe she is, it's a state of mind. It won't matter if i think you're beautiful if you don't! No passive aggressive behavior! As John Mayer says in his song, Say What You Need To Say! Don't assume anything and hope I'll figure it out. I need kindness, to children, the elderly, the disenfranchised, the earth, ME, strangers. My glass is always 3/4 full, don't know where the 1/2 came from, why stop there! I'm in the public eye in many ways, trying to empower others to be the best they can be, success is a relative term not only defined by your bank account. I'm not concerned as much by what you do as who you are! I don't need you for your career, your money, your house on the beach or your fancy car. My roots are solidly working class and that work ethic defines me and my view of others. We all put our pants on the same way, presidents and kings, paupers and janitors. Communication in it's many forms is all we have at the end of the day. I'm looking for a woman with a good sense of humor who is caring, confident, can laugh at any situation or herself, can admire me for my mind and personality, she is self sufficient, has integrity, intelligence, trustworthy and young in spirit. Has good character, drug-free, responsible, keeps her word and knows how to have fun. Someone who appreciates the journey as much as the destination, who looks for new experiences, savors a good conversation, enjoys exchange of ideas, sometimes even spirited ones, has a love of life and wants to live it to the fullest. One who is secure enough not to need a pencil thin man....Someone who has her own interests. Someone with whom I can share my interests as well as enjoy hers to broaden both our horizons. I am looking for someone I can enjoy growing old with. Friendship first, get to know each other and let the rest take care of itself. The real work of a relationship is to first become a worthy friend. Best case scenario, the sparks will fly; worst case, you will have gained a good and loyal friend. I enjoy the simple things in life. The sound of rain hitting a tin roof, the singing of birds as spring starts to bloom, the magnificent colors that fall provides, it's my favorite time of the year. Give me a beach, a bushel of crabs, family and good friends anywhere and anytime and I'm in heaven. Faith has gotten me through the pain and brought me to where I am. We are where we're suppose to be, embrace your adversity! Direct and unfiltered, I mean no harm but your skin should be thick enough to know I want you/us to grow every single day by every new experience, good and bad. I read self help, business books and always seek ways to make myself and the world a better, kinder, gentler place Care to join me on my journey? While we may never be lovers we may be great friends, close a business deal, make the world a better place. My best and most sincere good wishes to you!

Who had the world at his fingertips. Now mind you, this boy lived an average life: liked video games, watched cartoons (or whatever else came on Saturday morning/night!), hung out with the neighborhood kids from time to time, played a game of freeze/movie/whatever else came to mind tag, played with fireworks on the 4th of July, rode our bicycles and razors and rollerblades off of makeshift ramps without helmets, savored the taste of pixie sticks, made funny faces while eating warheads, and could never quite finish a jawbreaker; he did the things that made kids kids. But this particular kid also liked to keep to himself and stayed out of trouble. He would always go with the flow. And this was a cute kid if I don't say so myself ^_^. As he became older the boy went to school, earned some good grades, some bad, someâ¦.well we won't mention those here ;). Cartoons turned into anime, tag turned into dating, skates turned into cars, candy turned intoâ¦.heheh not really (candy is still awesome). Made some awesome friends along the way, made some even more awesome memories, although some of the awesome things that he learnedâ¦.were learned the hard way. But he learned about responsibility, reliability, compassion, integrity, faith, confidence, and friendship; as well as the reverse of these qualities. And he was better because of it. One day, very suddenly, school was over. Everything he had previously known was about to undergo a drastic transformation. But the boy did not despair for what he had learned kept him on his own two feet. The boy decided that he wanted to go somewhere in life. He was done letting life take him where it would. He would mold his life into that of his own choosing. And he would make something of himself. Because to him, failure is not an option. Then that boy became a man."

I also think evolution is a fact. My typical activities include reading and sipping coffee when I am not working as a freelancer. I am self-employed and like the freedom this affords me. I tend to dabble in the arts and enjoy writing, playing music on my guitar, painting, art shows and artistic friends. I get excited about philosophical discussions and people who use their minds. I like going out for drinks, but don't like getting sloppy drunk in public. I can be sort of shy and quiet when I'm nervous. Once I warm up I tend to be warmed up. In a nutshell, I just would like to meet new folks and hang out. Who knows where it might lead? I don't expect nor do I believe in love at first sight. I just don't know where to meet folks other than a coffee shop, and let's admit it, it's just weird to walk up to a total stranger sitting alone at a coffee shop and attempt to strike up conversation.

I am very passionate about the music I listen to. I know that sounds very cliche, but for example I have read two biographies about Pink Floyd (my favorite band, tied with Led Zeppelin and The Beatles). I used to be very close-minded to new music, but I am slowly opening up. Within the past couple years I have become very obsessed with EDM (electro house/dubstep/house). Going to concerts and shows is one of my favorite activities! I also get very into TV shows on Netflix, and movies.

I get better, you get karma points ;) My story starts 25 years ago in a mountain village in Romania (if you think Romania is what you saw in the movie with Borat you are very wrong) and until I was 7 years old I had to take care of a few sheep (you know those furry guys who say behehehe all day long) - that's a great job; how many people can say they worked in a leadership position at that age? :) You probably think I'm kidding, but I'm not. I can tell you more, but a glass of red wine is absolutely required. Let's end the story here because you might think I'm a crazy cowboy from Europe. I used to be, not any more. How did I do the shift? Simple, I went to school :) I graduated university with a major in software engineering and worked for Google in California. If you ever used Google Translate you can write me a message and tell me about your funniest experience with the product :) My friends say I am a geek..but I don't believe them. Why am I in Vancouver? Well because I didn't want to become a corporate guy at such a young age...and together with two of my best friends decided to start our own business in software. We had to find the right place to make this happen and Vancouver was a clear winner. So since I arrived here I've been working on this like crazy...and we still suck, but it's ok :) I've been told that success is going from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm. I'm testing it :D really hard :D Anyway, I don't want to make you feel bored with geeky stuff :) One a side note, even if what you've read until now sounds a bit crazy...at the end of the day I'm a serious guy who âthinksâ he knows what is doing. We all dream and make plans, but sometimes life takes you somewhere else...hopefully somewhere better than you thought. When I'm not working I like to be active...I go to the gym, do kickboxing (alone, want to join me?), go rollerblading in Stanley Park, play soccer, watch movies, go to a pub/club once in awhile. I also enjoy hiking and discovering new places in Vancouver. One more thing..I grew up far from the North American culture...so for me personal values are very important..and yeah..I think I am bit (maybe more) old school :) Enjoy life, do what you love!"

I'm vertically challenged. There I said it. Glad I got that out of the way. Imagine how awkward it would have been if you didn't know.... I'm what some would call pretty handsome, kinda charming, maybe charismatic, and absolutely funny. It may sound to good to be true.... But probably not.... (: My favorite passion is movies. I love the emotions and love almost every genre. Right now I'm into Asian films like The Good, The Bad, and the Weird, I Saw the Devil, and the Vengeance trilogy (definite recommend but very dark). My next genre, the classics. Also when it comes to directors; Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez, Coen brothers, and Mel Brooks. All of them GENIUS! I dare you to disagree. I wouldn't call TV a passion but a good pass time. The shows I currently watch are The Walking Dead (Best seen at Brewvies with a stout), Game of Thrones, Dr. Who and ""I've made a huge mistake"". *I'll let you figure out which show that is. Also If you didn't know (Shame on you), new episodes on May 26th on Netflix. Don't make a huge mistake... Now I know what you are thinking ""This guy is a total homebody!"" Well, you're right... No, no, I do like to get out. Things I like to do outdoors are hiking, camping, snowshoeing, BBQ's, **RMR, 5ks, and drinking a beer. Now hiking and camping aren't my hobbies so you wont hear me nerd out on Laminaâ¢ -15 (Long) a warm, affordable, and water-repellent synthetic bag, with unique Lamina construction for ultimate warmth -15 F/-26 C cause that's just not me.... When it comes to music, I enjoy most of it. I've been ***trying to get into country but main word being ""trying"". It may or may not be a little hard for me. But I have gotten into ****Astrud Gilberto, John Coltrane, and Glenn Miller. There're awesome, check them out. Now Something unique about myself would be; I play the *****harp, I live with a roommate, her name is Harvey (Don't worry ladies she's just a cat) I have a few activities I would like to get done this summer. Don't be shy, ask me what they are. Maybe you can join in some. TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) I'm short (not that short), I like movies, music, I play the harp and have a cat. Sounds boring right....? Take the time and read my profile, that's why you're here right? I'd do the same for you. * Nope, not telling but I'll give you another hint: ""I have got to hide my thunder, I'm a never nude."" ** RMR meaning Rocky Mountain Races. Now you know. You're welcome. *** Trying meaning not really trying meaning only if it happens to be playing happenstantially. That make sense? **** I know it's a little gay but its cool because I totally comfortable with my sexuality. She Rocks! ****** Harp meaning harmonica. That's what the cool people call it. Also Play meaning learning. Don't ask me to play anything, I'll only embarrass myself."

Not a fan of big productions, and I don't aspire to be the center of attention. Family tradition, (holiday festivities), classic movies, Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, baseball/football, flip flops, CNN, ESPN, NPR, Jimmy Fallon, crabs/beer, light piano or jazz with my early morning coffee, BIG hug - yea that's me. Acoustic singer/songwriter music - blues, soul, raggae. Bonnie Raitt, Buffett, Tony Bennett, Striesand, Van Morrison, Eagles, Heart, Chili Peppers, Shawn Colvin, Clapton, Bob Marley...oh, and sometimes - Queen played really LOUD..""Can anybody find me...somebody to love ""- I'm singing...no one is around of course.

I've been to more than 7 states and out of the country once to mexico, honduras, grand cayman islands, and belize. If you're adventurous then that's a plus. It's a big pet peeve of mine if a girl doesn't talk on the phone because if you don't then I won't be able to trust you if you're not a good communicator. What I want in a girl: I'm looking for a girl who has some common interests with & likes to try new things. It would be a plus for me to find a girl who likes to exercise and go to sporting events with me. On the other hand I want someone who is honest, caring, trusting, outgoing, has a job, has a car, talks on the phone, affectionate and loving, good sense of humor, and accepts me for who I am. If you're up for anything in life for fun then let's hangout and see how it goes. I'm the kind of romantic guy who someday hopes to live in a warmer climate after college, find a girl who likes spontaneous things and me surprising her, and being an overall fun loving gentleman with some sugar & spice. Music: I jam to rap, R&B, rock, pop, 80s, 90s, and a little bit of country. Karaoke is fun. Movies: I like action, scary, true story, comedies, love stories, sport related movies, and anything that looks good. Food: I love italian, spicy, cajun, ice cream, fruit, vegetables, protein shakes, Chinese, fish & grilled salmon, seafood, mexican, and sushi.

I run a website that handles video games, movies and music; it's a lot of work and effort for little gain but who cares cause I really love it. 9.) I'm very sarcastic and have been called witty more than once. I can have a conversation about almost anything, but philosophy, politics and history (to name a few) stand out. I can also argue with someone for an hour and not only refrain from hating them but actually like them more. 8.) I make an amazing home-made mac n' cheese. I'm constantly learning how to cook new (and more healthy) things too. 7.) I openly admit I am a nerd. My obsession with The Simpsons is the stuff of legends and I think girls who are into sciency stuff are sexy. 6.) I have made movies and music, and would be happy to discuss either. 5.) I'm incredibly patient and if you ever meet most of my former roommates you'll never doubt that statement. Holding grudges does not come easily for me. 4.) I spend ridiculous amounts of time with my 3 year old nephew, which is to say I could probably use a drink right about now. 3.) I have a degree in Political Science, but I'm not currently using it in any function. 2.) Most people who actually get to know me think I'm awesome. These people have done their research and should be listened to. 1.) I'm originally from Wisconsin and have only lived up here for a little over a year now. So yes, I like beer. Yes, beer is important enough to be in the #1 spot. Coffee is also amazing, and by amazing I mean life blood of the gods."

She wants to settle down however believes that is when the adventure truly begins and should be shared. Spontaneous enough to hop on a plane, travel to different places and experience other cultures. Someone that is in touch with her feelings and mine, unafraid of communication beyond talking, and has true values in her actions, attitudes and life. Finally, although both our lives are busy and full, I hope to find someone who agrees that our time shared is the most important time.

Im Nate. Im on here as another alternative to meet who I would discribe as a totally awsome and amazing woman. I would describe myself as a very chill and down to earth guy. I take life in stride and the good with the bad. I always try to be positive about every situation. I currently work as a teacher assistant in special education. I also coach softball and keep stats for basketball. Im a competative person so this is a perfect fit. I cant complain. I also am into cycling. I try to ride at least twice a week. Some of my hobbies are anything outdoors and adventerious. Ever been ziplining? Camping and hiking totally rock. I love all music except rap, hiphop, pop and "" the teenie bopper music"". Rock, country, and some alternative takes the cake. Im hoping to meet someone that has an awsome personality and has their life togeather. I believe common interests and chemestry makes the relationship happen. Without both, forget about it. There is much more to put here, but this will fly for right now. Everyone is different and each situation is unique. If I have peaked your interest, send me a message. I am looking forward to meeting a great young lady."

For each new encounter, with every name learned, new perils and new triumphs push us to evolve. With every step away from who we were yesterday, we get closer to who we truly are supposed to be. I tend to squabble with people over whether chivalry is dead or not. Personally, i believe it isn't. But this generation might be the one to see it finally die. I myself love seeing people smile and love doing things to help people.

I don't know, I sat here for like 20 minutes trying to think of something that wouldn't sound completely stupid or weird. I came up with this because typically I am a very shy person, but once I get comfortable I am usually quite funny. At least that's what I have been told :) So, if you made it past that first paragraph then I will make sure to give you a cookie if we ever meet. Now a little about me, I'm really not a very complicated person. I love stuff that can be an escape, like music and video games. But I'm also very big on spending time with my friends and just having a good time. Some of my best memories are just sitting in a park and talking with my friends. Also, I am a huge fan of Pokemon. Yeah its a little nerdy. But I'm proud of it. I can literally sit and talk about it for hours. I mean I literally get played to play pokemon. So yeah...it's kinda cool. My main interest/hobby/job (wow it has alot of titles) is that I make youtube videos, more specifically Pokemon videos. I love creating things and watching my visions come to life. I started in 2008 and have been going strong ever since. It's become one of my passions in life and hope it can lead to a career in the entertainment field later in life. Maybe I should have read some other profiles before doing this, overall I'm not exactly sure what all I should put here. Hopefully this was enough to get your attention, and if not, well then thank you for stopping by my page ^_^ Hope to hear from some of you :) I'm sure I didn't do a great job here, but if there is anything specific you would like to know about me or really any questions in generally then feel free to ask. I'm generally an open book and don't have much to hide!"

Music is my greatest talent and biggest passion. I would say that I am a well-rounded musician; being a singer and multi-instrumentalist. I like to go out and explore the city, restaurants, stores, etc. I also enjoy going to movies; it's a good place to get away from everything. I love the mountains and skiing/snowboarding, and hiking. I grew up learning to hunt/fish, enjoyed riding motorcycles, although I'm more of a city guy lately. I very much enjoy my time alone at home as well just reading, thinking, and/or watching a movie. I laugh and goof around a lot, am pretty well educated, and enjoy a good conversation. I always try to look at both sides of an argument and empathy is one of my greatest strengths. I consider myself unique and strong willed. I am a Christian, and am actively seeking God's will in my life. However, I'm not a religious zealot and am turned off by mindless fanatics. I love to travel, have been to Europe twice, and spent four months in Southern Mexico doing mission work and learning about the language and culture. I am taking a couple semesters off of school and working on establishing some more order in my life. My major is English with an emphasis in writing. Right now I work part time in food service, and do plan to continue and finish my education soon. I like many kinds of music, but primarily rock, punk, experimental/ambient; and classic country. Some of my all-time favorite bands are Social Distortion, AFI, Incubus, and 311. I would like to meet someone who has a sense of humor, who I can go see a movie with, ride bikes, cook a meal, talk about the world... We don't have be into all the same things, as we can be inspired to try new things by each other. I just want to share myself with someone, provide support and inspiration to her, and have her support, encourage, and inspire me. Communication is vital to a good relationship and/or date, and if things are not going well, one of us should let the other know right away so we can move on. Above all, let's just be up front, honest, and see if we're a match!"

I also love playing music along with hanging out with friends and family. All pretty standard. I work a fair amount and when I'm not, I'm usually with friends. I graduated college from Chico State and have a Bachelor's degree in Music Industry (I swear, the industry was a lot better when I was in school). It's great to be able to study music because like many things, it can be as intricate or as basic as you want it. Originally I planned on being in the restaurant industry for a small span while I looked for jobs in my field (which I'm still doing), but the restaurant industry is hard to leave. You meet so many great people from everywhere in the world when you work in a restaurant, especially in the gaslamp. It's fulfilling to talk with all these people from different places and get to know a little about them and where they come from. I've been in the restaurant industry for a total of 3-4 years and at my current job for 2 straight years. The restaurant and jazz bar I work at is closing down at the end of this year, after 28 years of being in business. Although I will miss the place and the people, I see this as an opportunity for me to find another job and adventure to embark on. I also coach competitive youth soccer. Coaching is another thing that I find so fulfilling. Having the ability to teach kids about a sport that has such a long history, complexity, and elegance is a privilege. I love the sport to no end and teaching it is something I can't get enough of. The look on my teams faces when they win a game, improve on a skill, and learn to love the game themselves is priceless. Currently I play bass and sing in a band. I've been playing music with one of my best friends for the past 9 years and the manner in which we play is strictly to have fun. We don't take music too seriously, it diminishes the joy of it. Being able to sit down and write music is great, being able to perform the music you care so much about in front of people who want to hear it is unexplainable. I'm not interested in trying to make it big (especially after spending 4 years studying about how hard it is for a musician to make it), I'm more interested in being able to express myself through music. My current band plays a......different kind of a music. Its got a punk/hard rock/blues/rock and roll/early metal sound to it. I've also played in bands of many other genres."

Of course I like the romantic notion of meeting someone at a library, grocery store or a coffee shop, but realistically it sounds easier than it is. Although, I do like the idea of getting on a website and meeting people who are looking for the same thing. I do know what I am looking for; maybe I will find it on here, maybe I won't. I am not looking to jump into a relationship; I am looking to make friends and meet new people and keep my options open, this should not be a deterrent. I AM NOT LOOKING TO JUST GET LAID, sex is great, but I got over that awhile ago. It would be wonderful to find someone like minded and compatible, someone who knows what they want out of life. I am looking for someone that can take care of themselves but wants to share that responsibility together, which is why I will take my time, get to know someone and go from there. I am 29 years old, I have my own house, my own cars, basically my whole life together and I have worked very hard on making it that way. I have a career and very very soon it will be a lucrative one. I have always kept in the back of my mind that in doing so, I will be able to take care of that special someone and have a life of fullness. I don't say this to attract gold diggers, but I do think it is ok to desire a man with ambition, goals and one who already at my age has achieved certain things. I am an open book, and I don't play games, like I said I am a go getter, when I see something I want, I go for it. I don't like the wishy washy bs, so I will be straight up, and I respect if someone is the same way with me. I am a positive thinker and I a grateful for everything I have. I do have sick tattoos that I drew they are two quarter sleeves, with a devil and an angel on my shoulder (girls of course)."

In light of how absurd, ridiculous, and profoundly sick society has become, I'm trying very hard to avoid ending up ""well adjusted."" In all fairness to ""society,"" perhaps it hasn't changed at all; my awareness and intuition are continually honed by experience. Maybe I'm watching the wrong youtube videos. I'm not a pacifist. Rather, I'm an adherent of the non-aggression principle, which does not preclude the use of deadly force for self-defense, if necessary. There is absolutely no other justification for violence, ever. I enjoy identifying the perverse incentives behind failing institutions. It's tempting to rail against injustice without framing it in its proper context. I don't believe in irrationality. The key to understanding my point is solving the problem of missing information. There is always a reason why people behave the way they do. We must discover what motivates them. When this information is missing, we commit a fallacy when we write off behavior which we perceive to be irrational. We commit atrocities when we arrogate the right to force behavioral changes in people whose incentives escape our understanding. Like her or not, Ayn Rand once wrote, ""Check your premises.""

Have we become a society that reduces our lifestyles and desires to ACRONYMS. I have been single for a year or so after an eight-year marriage and like so many of us, we browse through the various profiles to find a âharmoniousâ person. Then if we meet someone, we try to see if they are compatible and ponder.. How can this person fit into out lives? This can be much more complicated than one could imagine. We all want someone by our side, and don't really enjoy the loneliness. It's not too difficult to sustain a LTR but it's a two way street. We are not too old to compromise.

I LOVE technology, more specifically Apple products (I mean who doesn't!). I guess if you want to know more, message! Oh and good grammar is a plus!"

I don't have any baggage, I'm independent, work full time, own my own place, no kids, don't smoke, rarely drink, I'm fairly neat and tidy, can cook, eat reasonably healthy and I even put the toilet seat down so I am house trained. I'm not really a sport or car nut but for some reason I seem to enjoy watching basketball. I work in IT so my hobbies are in the technical area, I like fiddling with computers and playing videogames as well as sitting down to a good film but I don't watch much television. I'm also a little creative and can draw and write, attempt DIY around the house (planning on building a man cave when I can afford to) and like to get out in the garden and grow my own fruit and vegetables. I suppose my main flaw (if it is one) is I'm quiet and not all that outgoing which means I find it hard to meet people - which is why I'm on a stupid internet dating site, but I let people into my bubble once I warm up to them. I live in Victor Harbor because I like the nice weather and fresh air but work in Adelaide sometimes and can always go visiting when I want to - so don't let distance put you off. I don't know if I'll live here forever, but at the very least it's a great place to visit! Hope to hear from you soon."

I am content with the small things in life but work very hard to achieve the most I can in both my professional and personal journey. I have owned my own lawn care company in the past, which gave me a great understanding of the business world. I currently manage a restaurant... I have a very joyful outlook on life. I don't let things get me down or deter me. I am the type of person who is always laughing and having a good time. I enjoy life and would always prefer to smile than frown... I take good care of myself. I exercise routinely and have a good sense of style. I carry myself well. I walk with my head held high. I am a confident man but I am also humble and thankful. I am looking for someone I can share my life with. I have done and seen many things but I cant get the full value out of them by myself. I am ready to start the next chapter of my life. I am ready to find my other.

You get bonus points if you can sing off-key or play an instrument terribly for a jam session with me and my friends. I do listen to all types of music though. Mostly hip-hop/r&b and alternative rock. Pop music is fun to sing to the top of my lungs to while driving. Care to join me? I like to laugh and smile because you can't take life always to seriously.

I enjoy reading, writing, and making my own wine (mead in particular). Some people are bound to find me boring due to my passionate love of relaxation. I often find myself butting heads with religious types, though this is not born of malice as much as a serious interest in moral philosophy. I also have a completely irrational problem with the concept of internet dating. I have NO good reasons for disliking it, and therefore can't condemn it. The concept just doesn't sit quite right with me. After establishing that I'm being irrational, I gave in to a friend's pressure to put up a profile."

I like to stay active, I work a lot, i work out regularly. Excercise helps keep me happy. I'm very competitive, been heavy into sports my whole life. I love solving puzzles, funny thing is people are puzzles just everybody is a different one. I like to try and figure them out."

I write ALOT of poetry. Writing songs and poetry is my personal emotional outlet, and the means for which I deal with things (both good and bad) that occur in life. Here is a sample (that I just made up) ;) I live life to the fullest. I laugh and have fun. I'm far from the coolest, yet I will never run... .. from the problems and pain. Instead I will dance in the rain. I use my heart and my brain, to spread joy and not drain. I hug myself when I'm hurt, down crying alone in the dirt. I'm not the type to really flirt, When I have a thought, I exert. I'm not afraid of true love, I fly free like a beautiful dove. All of the lies, I live above. I'm loyal to a fault, thereof. I don't do flings or one night stands. I'm not after sex or anything material. I'm interested in seeing who else is out there. We should start out as friends, and see how compatible we are in that area, for that is VERY important. I have met kindred spirits in the past, and am hoping to maybe connect with a few more while I'm here. A kindred spirit is someone for whom your energy (or soul) was connected to in the past. Meeting such people is such an amazing experience. Kindred spirits can be the best of friends and also lead to soul mates. To find that one person that you can grow old with, and love EVERY moment of life together! That is the goal. :) I am really a physical touch person. I love hugging, cuddling, holding hands, petting hair (I've been known to purr when pet :p)."

(Insert smug smiley or whatever it is that should follow to make that comment not so self absorbed) Update : As of 1st february. The long hair is gone. I have a certain attraction to Insanity. yup, you read it right, insanity. I am a born rebel, i live a rebel and i will die one. I question everything, analyze everything and i have no problem speaking my mind. I have my own time zone, it's called RNT, random not-so-standard time. I eat when I feel like, I barely sleep and study in the middle of the night. I have no idea or intension to follow a routine. Okcupid constantly reminds me that I have to put more crap into my profile. I tried, but got bored of trying. If i look at your profile too many times, its probably because I have forgotten everything about you except your face. Yes I know, I am a horrible person. I am stubborn, honest, and mentally retarded"
